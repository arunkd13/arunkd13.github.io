The [Andhra Pradesh Community managed Natural Farming](https://apcnf.in/) or
APCNF project is the only active government run natural farming program I could find in
India. They have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@APZBNF) that has a
large number of videos showing the principles and practices that are recommended
to farmers, but most of them are in Telugu. Even though I follow a bit of
it, I was not able to get the full details of specific procedures they recommend
to the farmers. [Vijay Kumar](https://nfcoalition.in/people/t-vijay-kumar/) who
heads the APCNF organization, has promised in one of the webinars held recently,
that the content will be translated to
English for the benefit of people from the other states of India. 

One of the most valuable finds from the APCNF channel was the lecture by Walter
Jehne, an Australian microbiologist and cliamtologist, on [Regenerative
Agriculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXR3zLIM1U). His theory is that the
natural systems like soil and forests have kept the climate in a steady state
through millions of years through the natural process of rainfall and
transpiration. The destruction of forests and soil to acquire land for modern
industrial scale agriculture has had more impact on global temperatures than
increase in CO<sub>2</sub>. By restoring these systems, we can bring down global
temeperatures. Also restoring the soil goes a longer way in capturing rainfall
than building dams and other irrigation projects. 

APCNF itself uses these theories and applies them to the farming practices
followed by actual farmers which is were the real test lies. For a short
overview on APCNF, I would recommend [this booklet called Taking Agroecology to
Scale](https://afsafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/natural-farming-guide-digital-lr.pdf)
by an organisation called Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA), which
had studied APCNF with the goal of applying the learnings in Africa.

My own journey in farming has been influenced till now by [Masanobu
Fukuoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka),
[Nammazhvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Nammalvar), [Roland
Bunch](https://www.echocommunity.org/en/resources/a045e67c-53fa-4ff9-be2a-f24707d41b58)
and my own experience battling the _arugampul_ (Cynodon dactylon) ridden
compacted soil for the past 1.5 years (since January 2023).

Below, I have collected my thoughts on the APCNF principles and how I can
integrate them into my own practice.

1. **365 days of ground cover**

    It is obvious that having something growing throughout the year maximizes the
capture of solar energy and adds more biomass to the soil. But this is also
important for keeping the soil life alive and ready for the next crop. Also, soil with
growing plants capture more of the rain water than barren soil.

    The main challenge in my land is supplying the required soil moisture for
growing crops througout the year. The well on my farm has sufficient water for
irrigation only during January to March, which is after the heavy North East
monsoon during the months from October to December. There are a few scattered
showers during the months of April and May, but they are not sufficient to
establish any new crop. The South East monsoon which starts in June, brings
intermittent rainfall, but I haven't been able to retain enough moisture for a
successful crop in 2023 without additional irrigation. During the NE monsoon
season of 2023, I had the reverse
problem of water stagnation on my bunded field. I had missed to promptly drain
the fields after the bouts of heavy rains.

    To address these,
    1. I need to identify crops that are suitable for each of these
seasons. A crop that is already established during during January and February
can withstand the hot and dry months of March to May. So intercropping a short
duration crop and a longer duration crop could be a solution.
    2. The sequence of crops is also important. For example, it is better to
grow a grain or food crop after [mucuna](../search-for-mucuna) as it leaves the
field rich with nitrogen and reduced weed growth. Also, I am hoping that as the
soil structure improves, it can percolate more of the rain water allowing plant
growth during the dry spells.
    3. I also need to find an alternative to mucuna which
requires lesser water, as I will not have sufficient water for irrigation if I
increase the land under cultivation.

2. **Diverse crops including trees**

    Multi cropping i.e. growing more than one crop in the same field is a big part
of APCNF's recommendation. This is not just a legume and a grain intercopped,
but 8 to 12 species grown together.

    It is surely a challenge to grow so many varied crops in the same field close
together, even though I do everything with just manual labour. Harvesting
becomes more complex and I have to go through multiple passes, picking each of
the crop separately. Some crops like
mucuna cannot be grown together with other crops as they grow aggresively and
bury other plants below their lush growth, if there is sufficient water for them
to grow. Similarly, I have seen [Horsegram](../horse-gram) also smother other
plants.

    Another big part of this recommendation is growing trees along with field crops.
The trees supposedly provides shade and reduces evaporation of moisture
from the top layers of the soil. This would be useful especially during
the months from March to May when it might not be possible to have field crops
growing due to lack of water, whereas the trees with deeper roots would continue
to be growing. The trees can be pruned before establishing the next crop in June
or July to provide adequete sunshine for the field crop. The leaves and small
branches from the pruned trees can be used as mulch. This technique is also
called Alley cropping i.e. growing field crops between hedged rows of trees and is a
well established practice.

    Based on this,
    1. I need to determine compatibility matrix of each crop with the others.
    From this, I need to create guilds of crops that can be grown together.
    Combining this with the seasonal elements is going to be interesting.
    2. I need to find the perennial trees and long duration plants that can be
    grown on the hedge rows. I think it might be difficult to grow fruit trees in this manner as the field
    crop is going to get the higher priority in terms of when the tree will be
    pruned. Leguminous trees like _Agathi_([Sesbania
    grandiflora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesbania_grandiflora)) and
    [Gliricidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliricidia) are a good option.
    I also plan to expriment with trees that are naturally dispersed in my field like the
    [Neem tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azadirachta_indica), _Pencil Maram_
    ([Acacia auriculiformis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_auriculiformis))
    and the [Palm tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borassus_flabellifer). Timber
    trees like [Teak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teak) are also be a good
    option.
    3. Another interesting technique I intend to follow is called [Farmer Managed
    Natural
    Regeneration](https://www.echocommunity.org/en/resources/bb74e905-3feb-4c87-9638-1b4f028cd778).
    This is the technique where the farmer nurtures and grows the tree saplings
    that naturally popup every year all over the field and were sown by birds,
    squirrels and other animals. What a joy it is, to work with nature! 
    If let to nature, it is very much capable of turning the land into
    robust forest in a couple of decades, but we then lose our ability to grow
    field crops. So we still need to decide
    which saplings and how many, we nurture and which ones we destroy. This
    technique doesn't create neat rows of trees like in alley cropping, but
    the trees end up disperesed all over the field. Nevertheless, the utility
    should still be the same with no major disadvantages.

3. **No/low till**

    This was one of the key principles of Fukuoka and the primary technique which
pulled me into farming. I have clearly seen, from my experience, how tilling destroys
[the soil structure that nature had tirelessly built](../hello-earthworm).

    But starting from a compacted soil, it is very difficult to grow the first few
years of crop. Usually it is recommended to start with a well tilled field
without grass or weeds and follow no till from the second year onwards. For some
reason, I am not inclined to do it. I want to prove the power of nature in restoring even a
compacted degraded soil without fossil fuel inputs.

    The only disturbance I am doing is to dig a 1 feet wide trench every 1.5 meters
which I use for irrigation and also as a drainage mechanism during
rains. I use the soil from the trenches to form the tall bunds which demarcate
the fields and retain the water. The trenches can also be used to hold excess biomass
after laying out as mulch on the beds. The trenches are dug perpendicular to the
slope of the land and slows down the flow of water and helps in percolation.
It also provides a path to walk within the field for inspection
and harvesting. In effect the field looks like parallel rows of raised beds, which
makes the job of sowing a lot more cumbersome than broadcasting on flat
rectangular field.

    I have not been able to perform a true Fukuoka style broadcast sowing using
    seed balls. I am forced to hoe down the grass atleast an inch or two after I
    broadcast, without which the seeds do not have sufficient contact with the
    soil and are likely to be eaten away. Also hoeing kills the weeds and
    without which there is too much competition for the crop to get established.
    This is a back breaking work and is not scalable.

    I have been fascinated by Krishna McKenzie's technique of [sowing rice
    over a cover crop of mucuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0xmEDq3NIs).
    Mucuna forms a dense layer of vegetation which suppresses grass and other
    weeds and the crop grown after is able to establish quickly without much
    competition. The effort in preparing the soil by hoeing and drilling the seeds is greatly reduced.
    We simply broadcast the seeds over the growing mucuna plants and then we enter the field to
    cut the vines and shake it to ensure the seeds reach the soil and lay the cut vines over it. There is
    sufficient disturbance when pulling at the vines and stepping on the soil, to lightly bury
the seeds. The leaf litter and vines also cover the seeds to hide them
from birds and also decay quickly to form an additional layer of rich soil over the seeds.
    Also the crop gets to use the nitrogen fixed by mucuna,
    in addition to the nitrogen from the decaying green leaves.
    
    I have already tried this over one season, but had to still hoe down to
    remove the weeds that refused to be suppressed. I was also not confident that the
    seeds would get buried enough to have proper germination. I think over the
    years, the weed pressure should reduce so that I can skip the hoeing.

    Going forward
    1. I need to monitor the effort needed to sow on these raised beds vs a flat
    field. There are tradeoffs between sowing effort and the better irrigation
    between the two.
    2. I need to perfect the technique of sowing over a cover crop of mucuna as a scalable
    mechanism for planting and weed control. I should try this out with other
    grains like bajra and ragi too.
    2. I need to really evaluate if making seed pellets is worth the effort
    compared to sowing over mucuna. This will allow me to have two continous crops
    instead of having to reserve one crop for mucuna.

4. **Integrate animals into farming**

    Animals require more active care and constant human presence. I want to
establish a farming practice where I would only be present on the farm for a few
days of the week. If I had farm animals, I would have to employ someone who
needs to stay with the animals 24/7. This complicates the whole model. This
might be something I might consider later, but I decided to avoid using animals
for now.

    I still get dung from cows that the villagers graze on the uncultivated
parts of my land and also the adjacent land. The villagers do collect the manure
dropped and take it with them to their own fields, but, I have been able to
collect some for myself and have experimented with making crude _Jeevamurtham_
that I add to the irrigation water.

    _Manavari Velanmai_ is a traditional agriculture practice, where the farmer tills
the soil and sows the seeds before the rain and comes back to the field only to
harvest. So, there are precedences for avoiding constant presence in the farm.

    I do fancy growing hens, but it needs to wait until I have the food grain
    business going sustainably.

5. **Use of bio stimulants**

    APCNF recommends adding solid and liquid bio-stimulants made from manure and
plant carbohydrates and also making Fukuoka style [seed
pellets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cxJ9shbcI) treated with the same.

    As mentioned above, I have made a bit of crude Jeevamrutham, but could not see visible impact.

    Getting good quantity of clay for making the pellets has been a challenge. I have made small
quantities of clay by [dissolving the soil from my farm in water and letting the
water drip out of the solution through something like a cheese
cloth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca20JkKFAcE). But could not find an easy
way to grind the dried clay blocks to a powder to use in the pelletization
process.

    Taking this forward,
    1. I need to find a good way
        to grind the processed dry clay and expriment with pelletization, atleast on a
        small scale.
    2. I need to evaluate the effectiveness of these bio stimulants in a more
    appropriate scenario. I also need to experiment using the palm fruit as a free 
    sugar source for making these bio stimulants.

6. **Crop residue and mulch**

    This matches Fukuoka's method of leaving the crop residue as a mulch over the
broadcasted seeds. I have clearly noticed the soil below the mulch retain
moisture better than the bare soil. This is also a key part of the Green Manure
Cover Crop practice advocated by Roland Bunch.

    Maximizing the organic matter production is a key requirement for this. I am
using cover crops like mucuna and sunn hemp purely for organic matter
production, although I don't have any other uses for them.

    1. I need to evaluate more dual purpose crops, which produce food in
    addition to large amount of bio mass. Some crops to try, include, Canavalia
    (_thamattai avarai_ in Tamil) which looks to be bit more palatable than
    mucuna and pigeon pea (_tuvarai_ in Tamil) which is similar to sunn hemp in
    growing in poor soil and withstanding drought.

7. **Farmer's own seed or local seeds**

    This is very import to make farming self reliant without any external input,
but, having sufficient quantity of seed stock of the right variety needed for
the season is difficult. Selling seeds on a small scale is made more difficult
by a number of laws that purport to maintain seed
quality. So the farmer needs to maintain their own robust seed bank. Vialbility
also reduces when stored for multiple years, along with insects
attacking the seeds. So the seeds need to be regularly replaced with freshly
seeds from growing crops.

    I have started out with buying most of my seeds from the local agricultural supply stores around Tindivanam. These are likely commercial varieties that might be bread to take advantage of chemical inputs. I haven't tried heirloom seeds yet.

    I have been able to replenish my seed bank with my own seeds for mucuna and sunn hemp, but doing it for the
food crops like, green gram, cow pea etc. has been difficult as I end up storing
the seeds incorrectly leading to insect atack.

    Going forward,
    1. I need a more disciplined storage method and a way to track their age.
    2. I need to study the characterstics of different varities of the same crop
    to select seeds suited for my climate, soil and the style of natural farming
    that I perform.

8. **Pest & disease management through botanical ingredients**

    I have not faced any significant crop loss due to pest attack, likely because,
the yield is already low due to other reasons. Also, it is said that, the pests
attack only weak crops and when external
fertilizers, either manure or artificial, is added, weak crops crowd out the field and end up getting attacked by pests.

    Hopefully I would be able to maintain the balance between yield and growing
hardy crops which can naturally repel insects and other diseases.

9. **Strict NO to chemical inputs**

    Obviously this is the easist principle to follow if you aren't constrained by
needing high yields. In addition to saving money, chemicals like Glyphosate
which is used as a weedicide, pose a risk to human health. Here I prefer using
the [precautionary
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle) of not using a
technique that has a risk of damaging
human health than waiting for it to be proven.

I have learnt a lot from APCNF and using it as a framework for evaluating my
current practice has given me a confidence that I am going in the right path and
number of new things that I can try out and improve on. I now have a better
picture of what my end goal looks like in my journey to grow food without using
fossil fuels.
