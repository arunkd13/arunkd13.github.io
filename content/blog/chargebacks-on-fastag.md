I have got a couple of chargebacks for less than Rs. 200 on my ICICI Fastag account,
in the past few years.

For the first one I totally panicked and raised a ticket
on the online portal which requested for the RC copy to be attached. It took
around a month for the amount to be returned back to my account.

This time in Nov 2023, I got another chargeback, but I missed to raise
a ticket immediately. After a few weeks I got a message that my complaint on the
chargeback has been raised. I was perplexed and logged into my account to
look for any tickets that have been raised. And there it was, a ticket
raised in my account, with the RC copy being a screen shot of a Bihar
Transport department website, which allows to pull up RC details with
vehicle number.

I am not sure if these are genuine faults in the system, but in any case,
I think allowing the company running the toll booth to both raise a
chargeback request and also automatically raising a ticket to dispute the
chargeback, is a process that can be easily abused. Since it takes more than
a month for the dispute to be resolved and money credited back to the
Fastag account, it can be used as operating cash by someone in the system.

My guess is, this is likely the toll operators who are doing this. With a
trickle of chargebacks and resolutions after a month, this can be made
to look like genuine faults, but they benefit with a huge cash flow.

Probably someone needs to file an RTI requesting for the details and also
if there are any penalties levied on the toll provider for incorrect 
chargebacks.

Searching on the Internet, I found [this thread on team-bhp.com](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/street-experiences/210138-raise-dispute-trip-new-trick-toll-plazas-cheat-fastag-users-2.html)
dating back to 2019 raising similar concerns. And another [long wieldy article
on
moneylife.in](https://www.moneylife.in/article/fastag-wrong-deductions-why-complaints-are-not-getting-resolved-sooner/63149.html)
giving some data on chargebacks, but nothing that suggests a proper
resolution for this issue.
