raw.githubusercontent.com domain is blocked by Jio and possibly other ISPs in
India. This likely be due to a wise government or court order. There is an
substantial [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231553)
discussing this issue, but the situation has been the same now for more than a
couple of months.

Until it is fixed, the best way to get unblocked is likely using the [Tor
Browser](https://www.torproject.org/).
