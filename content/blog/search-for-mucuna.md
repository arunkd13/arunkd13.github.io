I first came across Mucuna, last year, as Black Velvette Bean during the
[Saturday Farm Tour](https://solitude.farm/farm/) at Solitude Farm, Auroville.
[Krishna McKenzie](https://krishnamckenzie.com/) explained its benefits for
controlling Parkinsons disease etc. in his inimitable style, but it went way
over my head at that time.

In my search for cover crops for my no-till farming experiments, I came across this
excellent blog called [My Experiments with
Farming](farming-experiments.blogspot.com/)
where Nandakumar talks about using [Mucuna as a cover
crop](https://farming-experiments.blogspot.com/2014/09/invasive-cover-crops-pueraria-javanica.html).
Interestingly Krishna McKenzie too has a video where he uses Mucuna as a cover
crop which he cuts and [mulches over rice
seeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0xmEDq3NIs). Access Agriculture, is
another website that I trust, which also exudes the [benefits of
Mucuna](https://www.accessagriculture.org/reviving-soils-mucuna).

With so many good things that I heard, I decided to try it in my farm and was
looking for a supplier. I initially contacted [Vinayaga
Pharmaceuticals](https://www.indiamart.com/vinarghya-pharmaceuticals/), through
IndiaMART, but they were quoting Rs. 220 per kg + Rs 80 for courier. I also
found a neighbouring natural farmer, but he was quoting Rs. 400 per kg.

I finally ordered it from the [ICAR - IIHR Seed
Portal](https://seed.iihr.res.in/) for Rs. 120 per kg with an additional postal
and packaging charges of Rs. 118. This was in January 2023. The variety was
marked as ARKA Dhanwantri.
