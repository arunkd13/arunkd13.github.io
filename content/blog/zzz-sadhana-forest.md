Auroville has always been a place that had held my curiosity and I had visited
the [Auroville Earth
Institute](https://auroville.org/page/auroville-earth-institute-avei-237) and
[Solitude Farm and Cafe](https://auroville.org/page/solitude-farm). These were
just visits of a few hours, but for the summer holidays I wanted to volunteer in
one of the communities for a few days along with my son.

After going through activities listed on the [Auroville
Website](https://auroville.org), [Sadhana
Forest](https://auroville.org/page/sadhana-forest) sounded like a good option.
While most places required you to volunteer for a few months, Sadhana Forest
allowed a minimum stay of 5 days for visitors. I shooted an email to them to
confirm the details and on the side, started the more difficult task of
convincing my son.

Didn't do much research and went with only a few expectations, but the
experience was awesome and would recommend this. Stay with your family and kids.
Show them how to live and have deep connection with life and nature.

Core Values:

Vegan: Less resource consumption compared to being a meat eater. Apex predators and carnivorous animals population is usually very less as there is a natural balance in nature. But humans using their unique brains, are able to overcome the limitations of nature and leads to unsustainable consumption.

They serve Vegan food

Compassion: Look at other life as not just a competition. Praying to the spirit of the cow before eating it. Goshala and food for dogs.

Off-grid: Solar panels. Bore well and water purifier without RO.

Seva: Short term volunteers. Long term own. Serving without expectation. All work.

Compost Toilets: Using visitors to fertilize the forest. No dtergetns and industrial chemicals.

Gift Economy: The Free Store. Visitors and free dinner. Tea Hut.

Sanctury for anyone who thinks life isn't worth living.

Read Aviram's book.
