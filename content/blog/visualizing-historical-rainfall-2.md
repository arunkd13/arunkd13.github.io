In 2023, I made a [visualization of the historical rainfall over my farm](visualizing-historical-rainfall.md) to help me improve my farming practice. This was made using the the [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) tool.

Now in 2024, Observable folks released the [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/),
which is a Javascript framework that can be used to create standalone
visualizations and built into a static website. This sounded exciting and I decided to take another
stab at rainfall visualization using this framework.

You can see it embedded below.

You can also access the [standalone website](https://arunkd13-public.observablehq.cloud/climate/). The [source code](https://github.com/arunkd13/climate-dash) is available on Github.
