All [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) channels have a subscribe button, but there is no good way to consume the videos from the channels once you have clicked on it.

Youtube does show a list of all the subscribed channels on the left side bar. It also shows a big list of all the videos from all your subscribed channels sorted with the most recent at the top. But these become unweildy, once you have more than a couple of subscriptions. The main reason is, your subscription contains channels pertaining to more than one of your interests, but at a certain time, you are in the mood to watch videos only from a specific interest. Also, the big list of videos is not grouped by channel and so is cluttered by the ones that release videos more frequently.

There are a number of ways to improve this UX, but Youtube isn't interested in doing it. My guess is, if they did so, it would give more power to the channels and also the users. Instead they want themselves to be the gate keepers of the video you watch next. This provides enormous power to Youtube:
* The channels are at Youtube's mercy if they want their videos to be discovered by more people. Sponsored videos now can bring in more revenue.
* The users can be shown endless stream of addictive videos, thereby increasing the hours per customer metric and consequently the ads per customer too.

Google, the owner of Youtube once had this motto called ["Don't be evil"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) which looks like has long been officially removed. The trust and good will that Google had in its initial days has been sold to the highest bidders. Google feeds on their users' addiction and on the other end the channel owners likely make lesser than they used to. In such a hostile environment, there are still some places of refuge.

One of them which I have personally used and like is the [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) Android app. This allows to search, browse videos from channels and also group your subscription based on topics, so that, you can have a more focussed video session catching up on a specific interest. I still would like a few improvements on the video feed screen, but since it is open source, I should be able to add them myself. Or I could even create my own app using the [NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor) library, which is part of the same project and used by NewPipe.

Since NewPipe is not very amenable to Google's designs, it is not allowed on the official Play store. But you can still install it directly from [their website](https://newpipe.net/) or from the [F-Droid app store](https://f-droid.org/) as explained in their home page. It might sound daunting at first for someone who is not tech savy, but I promise, it is worth the effort.

NewPipe also does not display any ads that you would see with the official Youtube app or the website. This obviouly means, the channels lose the potential revenue. This may sound like a bad thing, but in the long run, the high quality channels will survive as people would be more willing to direcly fund them through their website or other means. The low quality ones, might wither away.

Overall I think these pirate apps keep the ecosystem healthy.
