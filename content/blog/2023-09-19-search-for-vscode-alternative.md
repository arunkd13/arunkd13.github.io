I was looking for an alternative to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
for light editing needs alongside of Android Studio. With Visual Studio Code eating up 360 MB
of RAM when loaded, I can get close to having my entire 8 GB RAM used up.

After a round of eliminating the alternatives that came up in a Google search, I narrowed
down on [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), which is the text editor by the venerable KDE
project. It met all my requirements viz. Vim mode, and inbuilt Git support and occupied
just 86 MB of RAM when running.

The also-rans where, [Lightable](http://lighttable.com/) with 109 MB of RAM usage, but without
inbuilt Git support and [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/), with 895 MB of RAM usage.
