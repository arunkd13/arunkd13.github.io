Couldn't think of a great name when I started this blog and so added my handle as a placeholder for quite some time. One day it struck me that I should simply follow Mahatma Gandhi's lead and name it 'My Experiments with Truth'. This name sounded strange to me when I first heard it as a school kid studying in probably third standard. "Wow, someone is experimenting with truth. So he must be probably trying to lie". Gandhi does mention an incident where he lied (quote).

Gandhi's experiments that I like:
* self reliance - Kadhi, improving the village
* Health - Not just follow the heard. Water therapy and what not.
* Religious reforms - 

Decided to drop the truth part as a deference to Gandhi's biography. If you haven't read it, you should stop reading this blog and read that book first.
