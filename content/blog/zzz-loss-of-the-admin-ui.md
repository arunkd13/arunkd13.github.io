Surprised how much control is retained without being given to the user. Obvious who owns the device.

Governments get censorship, back doors etc. The device owners are locked out of the devices they own and host in their homes or pockets.

Companies encourage addictive behavior. Owners do not get ability to control how they and their children use their devices.

Bring back the admin UI.
