Buy acetate frames. Traditional material for light weight and strong frames. There are lots of innovative materials, some of which are more costly and others cheaper, but they are not value for money.

Lenskart, has a SINGLE offer, which is better than buying membership. Best is the basic lens is free and I have found them to be sufficient. Titan, is costlier and lense charge is separate. Quality seems to be slightly better, but cost is > 2.5x.
