_Karambu_ in Tamil refers to a field that is no longer cultivated.

There are trees that grow naturally without anyone planting them. Nature disperses the seeds through birds and other animals. But still you see flat plains of karambu without any trees. This is because the local farmers let their cows and goats rampage these saplings. Also, trees in their adolescence risk being cut by the local farmers for fire wood or other cheap purpose.
