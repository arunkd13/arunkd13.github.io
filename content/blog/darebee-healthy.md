After an acute spike in my blood sugar in November 2020, I embarked on a strict
process involving keto diet, intermittent fasting and strength training
exercise. More than 5 years before that, I was diagnosed with fatty liver which
I largely ignored and was visibly overweight. After the intervention in 2020, I
probably lost around 20 kg of weight and 4 inches in waist size.

Exercise was indispensible part of this process. Cost many times does indicate
quality, but when it comes to knowledge and learning, it is always a contra
indicator. What is costly is costly, because, they try to make your learning
path easy, which often reduces the results. I was always wary of buying
education. 

I viewed my exercise journey as an education process and decided to seek out
high quality sources where they aren't trying to sell you.

I started with [Rowen Row's channel on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@RowanRow) with mostly following this no equipment exercise routine.

After a few months I wanted a bit more of variety and started on a [28 day
fitness program based on videos by a person called Ashley
Conrad](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLXmeIOBkPXRV32fch2mbJgHK8k0xu31n).
I still remember not being able to do the [standing quadricep
stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdB1HMCldJY&list=PLLXmeIOBkPXRV32fch2mbJgHK8k0xu31n&index=4&t=324s),
which involves standng on one leg, without holding on to a support. After more
than 3 years of practise, I have gained my balance.

One of the real world uses of strength is in fights and [Mixed Martial
Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) or MMA piqued my
interest. I enjoyed watching the fights and read through [The Ultimate Mixed
Martial Arts Training
Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6966926-the-ultimate-mixed-martial-arts-training-guide)
by Dann Plyler. This talked about the philosophy and techniques used. The book,
[Trainig for
Warriors](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1735237.Training_for_Warriors) by
Martin Rooney had a bit more on exercise routines and I diligently practised them
for a few months.

As with any good habit, it is easy to lose a streak and gaining it back is
difficult. I often lose interest and many times my thrifty thought of _'exercise
is a waste of time and resources and instead I should rely on more manual work'_,
takes over. Once a streak is lost, it is difficult to get it back. Also now that
I am in a far better shape, I am no longer motivated enough to do the strenuous
1 hour sessions I used to do.

This is when the [DAREBEE](https://darebee.com/) website helps a lot. I found
this a year back and was my next stop after the MMA encounter. DAREBEE has bite
sized pages that focus on a specific theme and has  multiple difficulty levels.
These can also be conveniently downloaded as PDFs to help refer during
exercises, wherever you are. Now that I am familiar with the basic movements of
exercses and their functions, I no longer need complete videos. The wide
variety of the exercise collection and the interesting gamification in some of
them all help sustain the streaks.

Now whenever I am in this mixed mood of not wanting to exercise because I feel
like I have lost it with the streak broken and on the other hand wanting to
exercise as I can clearly see the tire around my belly building up and feeling
more hungry and not able to control snacking, I push myself to do the 10 squats
and 10 pushups routine before my morning bath. This often helps me get back on
my streak.
