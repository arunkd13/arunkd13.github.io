I often hear people say, "...but the companies are here to make a profit. You cannot expect them to be do-gooder charity". Profit for whom? By supposedly US laws, they are bound to make profits for their investors. But the way Big Tech comapanies work today, is they never return any profit to their investors. Instead they pursue growth and lure of future stock price increase to increase their stock price. Growth comes to entering into adjacent maret, but more from using their monopoly power and trampling on the competition and making it difficult for their customers to switch. This enriches their executives with empire building. In that process they often do not care if they destroy the company. Investors lose, management gains.
