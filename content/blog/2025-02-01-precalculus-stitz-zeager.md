I was searching for a challenging maths book that would help my kids get
ready for learning Calculus.

I was looking for something which was a classic and which could be easily loaded
onto a small 6" Kindle e-reader so that I didn't have to print it out.  That is
when I came across this excellent book called
[Precalculus](https://stitz-zeager.com/) written by Carl Stitz and Jeff Zeager,
and released under Creative Commons Licence along with the [LaTeX source
code](https://stitz-zeager.com/Precalc4Source.zip).

I was excited and quickly downloaded it, updated the paper size to A6 and
rebuilt the PDF. But it looks like the LaTeX maths environment does not reflow
the equations and requires manual splitting to fit into the page width. Also,
the tables and the exercise sections used multiple columns, assuming a larger
paper width and got cropped when the paper size was reduced.

Given this is open source, I decided to start a new personal project to reformat
this book. If you are interested, do join me in this effort. Code available on
GitHub: [arunkd13/precalculus](https://github.com/arunkd13/precalculus).

PS: Before you ask, I searched for anyone else who had already started on this
work, but couldn't find anyone. I have also emailed Carl and waiting for a reply.
