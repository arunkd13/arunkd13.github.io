This seems to be very similar to Fukuoka's seed ball technique adapted to the tropics. From my limited understaning from the videos, the farmers pelletize the seeds with a coating of clay and an organic growth promoter called haven't been able to make good seed balls or pellets was not able to get good clay for coating. Trying to make clay from the best clayey soil I could find in my farm.
