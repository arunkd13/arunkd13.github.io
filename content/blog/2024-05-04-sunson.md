Right from my school days when I started using the Internet, I had been
following people on the Internet, from whom I have continously learnt and shaped my
understanding of the world. Although it might sound a bit kitsch, I would compare this to the
relationship between [Ekalavya and
Dronacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya), but the comparison breaks
down when I gratefully recollect how much more I have received from my gurus than
what Ekalavya received from Dronacharya. And have I been as worthy a student as
Ekalavya? I don't think so.

One of these exemplary gurus and closest to my heart has been Suraj Kumar. I
remember, the first time I saw him was around 1998, in one of the ILUGC (Indian Linux User's
Group - Chennai) meetings held regularly in the IIT Madras campus. He was the same age as
me, but vastly more knowledgeable and driven. I was this reticent Linux newbie
and was at
awe with the MoM's he wrote after
each meeting - every detail captured in his pleasant style with a unique sense
of humour.

I continued to follow his posts as [@sunson on Live
Journal](https://sunson.livejournal.com/) and [@sunsonian on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/sunsonian). The later half of the 2000s were the
heydays of Web 2.0 and
there were increasingly more options for staying connected and learning from my
gurus.

I internalized a number of life changing concepts like [Peak
oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil) and
[Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) through his writings and
the links he posted on the wonderful [Delicious bookmarking
website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)). He introduced me to
other communities like [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives)
which opened their own wide worlds.

Although I was already an atheist, @sunson's explorations and thoughts were much
deeper. He introduced me to [Richard
Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) and I devoured his
books, [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) and
[The God Delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion).

The biggest impact he had on me must be his [efforts at natural
farming](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sunson/albums/72157626205527503). I
eagerly followed his journey as he introduced me to [Masanobu
Fukuoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka)'s writings and
[Nammalvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Nammalvar)'s work.

This had a great impact on my own journey into natural farming that I
started in January 2022.

Looks like everything ends where it starts and I learn [from this post on the ILUGC mailing
list](https://www.freelists.org/post/ilugc/ILUGC-Trichy,6) that @sunson is no longer
with us. In this ephemeral digital
age, I am thankful that the Internet Archive's [Wayback
Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine) has his [Live Journal
blog
archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20231204190058/https://sunson.livejournal.com/),
although his delicious bookmarks and his personal website are lost. The Twitter
feed anf Flickr photos hang on a noose.

I really hope his writings survive the bitrot and continue to educate and
inspire more of us.
