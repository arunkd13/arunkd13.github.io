I started having excessive dandruff starting from my teen ages. The obvious solution at
that time was to switch from _Clinic Plus_ to _Head and Shoulders_ for my weekly
hair wash, which we call, the head-bath. The day of the head-bath, everything
looked spick and span, but on the next day, my whole head was filled with scales of dead skin. My favourite
pastime became, taking a newspaper and combing my dandruff onto it and
wondering in bewilderment at the amount of skin I had shed. Applying coconut oil
made the dandruff gooey like oversoaked breakfast cereal. Skipping it made it
look fresh, ready to be thrown it into a bowl.

Little did I know that the shampoo was making the problem worse by taking away
the natural oil layer secreted by the skin. The skin panicks on detecting this and secretes more
of its oil, which becomes a bumper food supply for the fungus, which then grows
exponentially, triggering the skin cells to molt in profusion. Ignorant of this,
I increased the frequency of shampoo use and ended up with just a bigger
dandruff mound on my newspaper.

That is when I came across [this video by _Dave
Hakkens_'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmiqG_XdePY) which introduced me to
the _No Poo_ movement.

I stopped usuing shampoo or for that matter even our traditional alternatives
like shikakai. Instead I started washing my hair daily with just plain water and
also skipped applying coconut oil. After a few months things looked better. The
absence of, the day-after-the-head-bath flare-up, itself, was a big relief. I continued this with
good success for maybe 10 years now.

This is also the period when I slowly moved away from hot water to unheated water
for bathing. This also likely helped reduce the stress on the skin as hot water
can remove natural skin oils more, than cold water.

Cold water for bathing was something that I dreaded from my childhood. There was
this childrens' magazine called [_Wisdom_](https://wisdom.in/) where I had read
that bathing in cold water is the best for the human body. In spite of this, I
could never make this a habit.

Starting from my home to my college in Pondicherry was a 3 hour journey that I
used to make almost every week and invariably it was a Monday morning. I had to
bath at around 4:30 AM, and hot water was what I used. Even though I had
bathed, by the time I reached college I had sweated a lot during the bus journey and felt so
uncomfortable sitting in the class, that I started walking all the way to the
hostel to take a cold shower and walked back to the college. During this time I
tried experimenting with taking bath in cold water instead of hot water,
before I started from home on the bus journey. Remarkably I sweated much less
and felt more fresh when I reached college.

Even with this, first-hand proof, it was more than 10 years later, that cold
showers became a habit.

Another thing I started skipping during this time, was, using bathing soap. I know, this
might be shocking and you might feel uneasy coming close to me, after knowing
this fact, but no one has complained to me, yet.

Similar to the _No Poo_ process, I do not use any traditional replacements like
moong dal powder, which people have suggested. Initially I used [dried ridge gourd
sponge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luffa) to scrub my skin, but after a few months I started using it less
frequently. Now, I use it very rarely, only in case I want to remove things like
oil, glue, paint or cement that is stuck. Otherwise, I just make good use of my hand
and fingers.

With the daily cold water head bath regimen running successfully, I did notice
that there was still some amount of dandruff and I realized, the daily head bath
may not be necessary. So now, I have switched to just a weekly head bath. In
addition, a bit of coconut oil on the hair after the head bath. This seems to
keep everything in a steady state.

"Wow, so, are the people who invented shampoo and soaps, fools?" you might ask.
If they have no use, how did they
get so popular? I suppose, they served a very narrow purpose when they were
invented, which was game changing, but then they started being used even when they
were not required. Shampoo and soaps are still the most advertised products on
Television, serving very much as a proof that, only unnecessary products are
advertised.

Antibiotics, paracetamol, sugar, fertilizers, the over-used-products list may just be growing.
