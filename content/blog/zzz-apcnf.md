The [Andhra Pradesh Community managed Natural Farming](https://apcnf.in/) or
APCNF project is the only active government run natural farming program I could find in
India. They have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@APZBNF) that has a
large number of videos showing the principles and practices that are recommended
to the farmers, but most of them are in Telugu. Even though I follow a bit of
it, I was not able to get the full details of specific procedure they recommend
to the farmers. Mr. https://nfcoalition.in/people/t-vijay-kumar/

One of the most valuable find from APCNF channel was the lecture by Walter
Jehne, an Australian microbiologist and cliamtologist on [Regenerative
Agriculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXR3zLIM1U). It goes through how
natural systems like forests have kept the climate in a steady state through
natural cycles, which have been lost due to industrial scale modern agriculture.
These systems have so much potential that, restoring them can reverse the global
warming caused by burning locked up fossil fuels.

For a short overview on APCNF, I would recommend [this booklet called Taking
Agroecology to
Scale](https://afsafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/natural-farming-guide-digital-lr.pdf)
by an organisation called Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA), which
had studied APCNF with the goal of applying the learnings in Africa.

My own journey in farming has been influenced till now by [Masanobu
Fukuoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka),
[Nammazhvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Nammalvar), [Roland
Bunch](https://www.echocommunity.org/en/resources/a045e67c-53fa-4ff9-be2a-f24707d41b58)
and my own experience battling the compacted soil that had been grazed with
cattle for a number of years (called _Karambu_ in Tamil) for the past 1.5 years,
since January 2023.

Below, I have collected my thoughts on the APCNF principles and how I can integrate them into my own practice.

**365 days of ground cover**

It is obvious that having something growing throughout the year maximizes the capture of solar energy. But this also should adds more biomass to the soil, keeps soil life functional, with legume, it fixes more nitrogen.

The main challenge in my land is supplying the required soil moisture for growing crops througout the year. The well on my farm has sufficient water for irrigation only during January to March, which is after the heavy North East monsoon during the months from October to December. There a few scattered showers during the months April and May, but they are not sufficient to establish any new crop. The South East monsoon which starts in June, brings intermittent rainfall, but I haven't been able to retain enough moisture for a successful crop in 2023. During the NE monsoon season of 2023, I had the reverse problem of water stagnation on my bunded field. I had missed to promptly drain the fields after the bouts of heavy rains.

To address these, I need to identify crops that are suitable for each of these periods. 

* crop residue and mulch - matches Fukuoka's method. Higher moisture content below the organic mulch is easily noticeable.
* diverse crops including trees - Supposedly provides shade and reduces evaporization of moisture content on the top layers of the soil
* minimum disturbance to soil - helps retain the soil structure that nature worked hard to build. Totally follows Fukuoka's methods. But highly compacted soil is not conducive to growth. Even legumes struggle to penetrate this soil. Will need minimal tillage and multiple seasons for the roots to do their work.
* farmer's own seed - absolutely a must. This clearly the way government can control the farmers. Seed soverigity. Restrictions on seed sale.
* integrate animals into farming - Animals require more active care. Absentee farmer. manavari payir - come only to sow and harvest.
* bio stimulants - I am bit hesitant on this. This is additional work and looks like health tonic and supplements. I have started a barrel with cow dung soakded for a week which I add to irrigation water.
* Pest & disease management through botanical ingredients: Same histation as bio stimulants. I would prefer for the natural pest predators to keep them in control and healthy soil to minimize diseases.
* Strict NO to chemical inputs: Absolutely agree with this. Herbicide is still not provien conclusively as harmless.
