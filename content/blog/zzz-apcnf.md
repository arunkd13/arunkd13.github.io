https://apcnf.in/ - The only government run natural farming program I could find in India.

* 365 days ground cover - totally agree. maximize productivity of solar energy to soil carbon conversion and soil life activity
* pre-monsoon dry seeding - fukuoka's seed balls. haven't been able to make good seed balls or pellets was not able to get good clay for coating. Trying to make clay from the best clayey soil I could find in my farm.
* crop residue and mulch - matches Fukuoka's method. Higher moisture content below the organic mulch is easily noticeable.
* diverse crops including trees - Supposedly provides shade and reduces evaporization of moisture content on the top layers of the soil
* minimum disturbance to soil - helps retain the soil structure that nature worked hard to build. Totally follows Fukuoka's methods. But highly compacted soil is not conducive to growth. Even legumes struggle to penetrate this soil. Will need minimal tillage and multiple seasons for the roots to do their work.
* farmer's own seed - absolutely a must. This clearly the way government can control the farmers. Seed soverigity. Restrictions on seed sale.
* integrate animals into farming - Animals require more active care. Absentee farmer. manavari payir - come only to sow and harvest.
* bio stimulants - I am bit hesitant on this. This is additional work and looks like health tonic and supplements. I have started a barrel with cow dung soakded for a week which I add to irrigation water.
* Pest & disease management through botanical ingredients: Same histation as bio stimulants. I would prefer for the natural pest predators to keep them in control and healthy soil to minimize diseases.
* Strict NO to chemical inputs: Absolutely agree with this. Herbicide is still not provien conclusively as harmless.
