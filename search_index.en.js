This likely is due to a wise government or court\norder. There is a substantial Hacker News\nthread discussing this issue,\nbut the situation has been the same now, for more than a\ncouple of months.\nThe block seems to be at the DNS level and I had sucess with using\nGoogle's Public DNS server.\nTo change the DNS server I updated the DNS servers setting in the\nJio broadband router under Network &gt; LAN &gt; DNS servers. Change the option to\nselect Use Below and enter Google's primary and secondary DNS servers viz.\n8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.. The DNS Servers setting seems to get reset to\nUse DNS Proxy, every time I reboot the router. So, finally I had to set the\ncustom DNS directly on my PC.\nOn my Redmi phone, there is no way to set a custom DNS as the setting has been\nremoved by Xiaomi. The easiest way to overcome this was to use\n1.1.1.1 + Warp\nfrom Cloudflare. This provides a VPN configuration that uses Cloudflare's\nfree DNS resolver at 1.1.1.1.\nSometimes the DNS server change didn't seem to work on my desktop. In this case, I got\nunblocked by using the Tor Browser. This doesn't\nhelp with other apps that make a request to raw.githubusercontent.com. I ran into\nthis problem again when installing Doom Emacs\nwhich unfortunately needed to download some files from the cursed github domain.\nAfter some Googling, I ended up using ProxyChains\nto make the Doom Emacs install command to use the local tor connection.\nsudo service tor start\nsudo apt install proxychains\nproxychains ~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install\n\nYay! I don't need to buy a VPN now, just because I cheaped out choosing Jio.\nUpdate: As of 5 October, 2023, I am still unable to access content from raw.githubusercontent.com\nwhen using Jio Broadband unless I use one of the above techniques.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/access-raw-githubusercontent/","title":"Access raw.githubusercontent.com files in India"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/apcnf/":{"body":"The Andhra Pradesh Community managed Natural Farming or\nAPCNF project is the only active government run natural farming program I could find in\nIndia. They have a Youtube channel that has a\nlarge number of videos showing the principles and practices that are recommended\nto farmers, but most of them are in Telugu. Even though I follow a bit of\nit, I was not able to get the full details of specific procedures they recommend\nto the farmers. Vijay Kumar, who\nheads the APCNF organization, has promised in one of the webinars held recently, that,\nthe content will soon be translated to\nEnglish for the benefit of people from the other states of India. \nOne of the most valuable finds from the APCNF channel was the lecture by Walter\nJehne, an Australian microbiologist and cliamtologist, on Regenerative\nAgriculture. His theory is that the\nnatural systems like soil and forests have kept the climate in a steady state\nthrough millions of years through the natural process of rainfall and\ntranspiration. The destruction of forests and soil to acquire land for modern\nindustrial scale agriculture has had more impact on global temperatures than\nincrease in CO2. By restoring these systems, we can bring down global\ntemeperatures. Also restoring the soil goes a longer way in capturing rainfall\nthan building dams and other irrigation projects. \nAPCNF itself uses these theories and applies them to the farming practices\nfollowed by actual farmers which is were the real test lies. For a short\noverview on APCNF, I would recommend this booklet called Taking Agroecology to\nScale\nby an organisation called Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA), which\nhad studied APCNF with the goal of applying the learnings in Africa.\nMy own journey in farming has been influenced till now by Masanobu\nFukuoka,\nNammazhvar, Roland\nBunch\nand my own experience battling the arugampul (Cynodon dactylon) ridden\ncompacted soil for the past 1.5 years (since January 2023).\nBelow, I have collected my thoughts on the APCNF principles and how I can\nintegrate them into my own practice.\n\n\n365 days of ground cover\nIt is obvious that having something growing throughout the year maximizes the\ncapture of solar energy and adds more biomass to the soil. But this is also\nimportant for keeping the soil life alive and ready for the next crop. Also, soil with\ngrowing plants capture more of the rain water than barren soil.\nThe main challenge in my land is supplying the required soil\nmoisture for\ngrowing crops througout the year. The well on my farm has sufficient water for\nirrigation only during January to March, which is after the heavy North East\nmonsoon during the months from October to December. There are a few scattered\nshowers during the months of April and May, but they are not sufficient to\nestablish any new crop. The South West monsoon which starts in June, brings\nintermittent rainfall, but I haven't been able to retain enough moisture for a\nsuccessful crop in 2023 without additional irrigation. During the NE monsoon\nseason of 2023, I had the reverse\nproblem of water stagnation on my bunded field. I had missed to promptly drain\nthe fields after the bouts of heavy rains.\nTo address these,\n\nI need to identify crops that are suitable for each of these\nseasons. A crop that is already established during during January and February\ncan withstand the hot and dry months of March to May. So intercropping a short\nduration crop and a longer duration crop could be a solution.\nThe sequence of crops is also important. For example, it is better to\ngrow a grain or food crop after mucuna as it leaves the\nfield rich with nitrogen and reduced weed growth. Also, I am hoping that as the\nsoil structure improves, it can percolate more of the rain water allowing plant\ngrowth during the dry spells.\nI also need to find an alternative to mucuna which\nrequires lesser water, as I will not have sufficient water for irrigation if I\nincrease the land under cultivation. Canavalia (thamattai avarai in Tamil), is\nsupposed to be more drought tolerant than mucuna.\n\n\n\nDiverse crops including trees\nMulti cropping i.e. growing more than one crop in the same field is a big part\nof APCNF's recommendation. This is not just a legume and a grain intercopped,\nbut 8 to 12 species grown together.\nIt is surely a challenge to grow so many varied crops in the same field close\ntogether, even though I do everything with just manual labour. Harvesting\nbecomes more complex and I have to go through multiple passes, picking each of\nthe crop separately. Some crops like\nmucuna cannot be grown together with other crops as they grow aggresively and\nbury other plants below their lush growth, if there is sufficient water for them\nto grow. Similarly, I have seen Horsegram also smother other\nplants.\nAnother big part of this recommendation is growing trees along with field crops.\nThe trees supposedly provide shade and reduce evaporation of moisture\nfrom the top layers of the soil. This would be useful especially during\nthe months from March to May when it might not be possible to have field crops\ngrowing due to lack of water, whereas the trees with deeper roots would continue\nto be growing. The trees can be pruned before establishing the next crop in June\nor July to provide adequete sunshine for the field crop. The leaves and small\nbranches from the pruned trees can be used as mulch. This technique is also\ncalled Alley cropping i.e. growing field crops between hedged rows of trees and is a\nwell established practice.\nBased on this,\n\nI need to determine compatibility matrix of each crop with the others.\nFrom this, I need to create guilds of crops that can be grown together.\nCombining this with the seasonal elements is going to be interesting.\nI need to find the perennial trees and long duration plants that can be\ngrown on the hedge rows. I think it might be difficult to grow fruit trees in this manner as the field\ncrop is going to get the higher priority in terms of when the tree will be\npruned. Leguminous trees like Agathi(Sesbania\ngrandiflora) and\nGliricidia are a good option.\nI also plan to expriment with trees that are naturally dispersed in my field like the\nNeem tree, Pencil Maram\n(Acacia auriculiformis)\nand the Palm tree. Timber\ntrees like Teak are also be a good\noption.\nAnother interesting technique I intend to follow is called Farmer Managed\nNatural\nRegeneration.\nThis is the technique where the farmer nurtures and grows the tree saplings\nthat naturally popup every year all over the field and were sown by birds,\nsquirrels and other animals. What a joy it is, to work with nature! \nIf left to nature, it is very much capable of turning the land into\nrobust forest in a decade, but we then lose our ability to grow\nfield crops. So we still need to decide\nwhich saplings and how many, we nurture and which ones we destroy. This\ntechnique doesn't create neat rows of trees like in alley cropping, but\nthe trees end up disperesed all over the field. Nevertheless, the utility\nshould still be the same with no major disadvantages.\n\n\n\nNo/low till\nThis was one of the key principles of Fukuoka and the primary technique which\npulled me into farming. I have clearly seen, from my experience, how tilling destroys\nthe soil structure that nature had tirelessly built.\nBut starting from a compacted soil, it is very difficult to grow the first few\nyears of crop. Usually it is recommended to start with a well tilled field\nwithout grass or weeds and follow no till from the second year onwards. For some\nreason, I am not inclined to do it. Maybe, I want to prove the power of nature in restoring even a\ncompacted degraded soil without fossil fuel inputs.\nThe only disturbance I am doing is to dig a 1 feet wide trench every 1.5 meters\nwhich I use for irrigation and also as a drainage mechanism during\nrains. I use the soil from the trenches to form the tall bunds which demarcate\nthe fields and retain the water. The trenches can also be used to hold excess biomass\nafter laying out as mulch on the beds. The trenches are dug perpendicular to the\nslope of the land and slows down the flow of water and helps in percolation.\nIt also provides a path to walk within the field for inspection\nand harvesting. In effect the field looks like parallel rows of raised beds, which\nmakes the job of sowing a lot more cumbersome than broadcasting on flat\nrectangular field.\nI have not been able to perform a true Fukuoka style broadcast sowing using\nseed balls. I am forced to hoe down the grass atleast an inch or two after I\nbroadcast, without which the seeds do not have sufficient contact with the\nsoil and are likely to be eaten away. Also hoeing kills the weeds and\nwithout which there is too much competition for the crop to get established.\nThis is a back breaking work and is not scalable.\nI have been fascinated by Krishna McKenzie's technique of sowing rice\nover a cover crop of mucuna.\nMucuna forms a dense layer of vegetation which suppresses grass and other\nweeds and the crop grown after, is able to establish quickly without much\ncompetition. The effort in preparing the soil by hoeing and drilling the seeds is greatly reduced.\nWe simply broadcast the seeds over the growing mucuna plants and then we enter the field to\ncut the vines and shake it to ensure the seeds reach the soil and lay the cut vines over it. There is\nsufficient disturbance when pulling at the vines and stepping on the soil, to lightly bury\nthe seeds. The leaf litter and vines also cover the seeds to hide them\nfrom birds and also decay quickly to form an additional layer of rich soil over the seeds.\nAlso the crop gets to use the nitrogen fixed by mucuna,\nin addition to the nitrogen from the decaying green leaves.\nI have already tried this over one season, but had to still hoe to\nremove the weeds that refused to be suppressed. I was also not confident that the\nseeds would get buried enough to have proper germination. I think over the\nyears, the weed pressure should reduce so that I can skip the hoeing.\nGoing forward\n\nI need to monitor the effort needed to sow on these raised beds vs a flat\nfield. There are tradeoffs between sowing effort and the better irrigation\nbetween the two.\nI need to perfect the technique of sowing over a cover crop of mucuna as a scalable\nmechanism for planting and weed control. I should try this out with other\ngrains like bajra and ragi and also experiment with other cover crops like\ncanavalia, instead of mucuna.\nI need to really evaluate if making seed pellets is worth the effort\ncompared to sowing over mucuna. This will allow me to have two continous crops\ninstead of having to reserve one crop for mucuna.\n\n\n\nIntegrate animals into farming\nAnimals require more active care and constant human presence. I want to\nestablish a farming practice where I would only be present on the farm for a few\ndays of the week. If I had farm animals, I would have to employ someone who\nneeds to stay with the animals 24/7. This complicates the whole model. This\nmight be something I might consider later, but I decided to avoid using animals\nfor now.\nI still get dung from cows that the villagers graze on the uncultivated\nparts of my land and also the adjacent land. The villagers do collect the manure\ndropped and take it with them to their own fields, but, I have been able to\ncollect some for myself and have experimented with making crude Jeevamurtham\nthat I add to the irrigation water.\nManavari Velanmai is a traditional agriculture practice, where the farmer tills\nthe soil and sows the seeds before the rain and comes back to the field only to\nharvest. So, there are precedences for avoiding constant presence in the farm.\nI do fancy growing hens, but it needs to wait until I have the food grain\nbusiness going sustainably.\n\n\nUse of bio stimulants\nAPCNF recommends adding solid and liquid bio-stimulants made from manure and\nplant carbohydrates and also making Fukuoka style seed\npellets treated with the same.\nAs mentioned above, I have made a bit of crude Jeevamrutham, but could not see visible impact.\nGetting good quantity of clay for making the pellets has been a challenge. I have made small\nquantities of clay by dissolving the soil from my farm in water and letting the\nwater drip out of the solution through something like a cheese\ncloth. But could not find an easy\nway to grind the dried clay blocks to a powder to use in the pelletization\nprocess.\nTaking this forward,\n\nI need to find a good way\nto grind the processed dry clay and expriment with pelletization, atleast on a\nsmall scale.\nI need to evaluate the effectiveness of these bio stimulants in a more\nappropriate scenario. I also need to experiment using the palm fruit as a free \nsugar source for making these bio stimulants.\n\n\n\nCrop residue and mulch\nThis matches Fukuoka's method of leaving the crop residue as a mulch over the\nbroadcasted seeds. I have clearly noticed the soil below the mulch retain\nmoisture better than the bare soil. This is also a key part of the Green Manure\nCover Crop practice advocated by Roland Bunch.\nMaximizing the organic matter production is a key requirement for this. I am\nusing cover crops like mucuna and sunn hemp purely for organic matter\nproduction, although I don't have any other uses for them.\n\nI need to evaluate more dual purpose crops, which produce food in\naddition to large amount of bio mass. Some crops to try, include, Canavalia\n(thamattai avarai in Tamil) which looks to be bit more palatable than\nmucuna and pigeon pea (tuvarai in Tamil) which is similar to sunn hemp in\ngrowing in poor soil and withstanding drought.\n\n\n\nFarmer's own seed or local seeds\nThis is very import to make farming self reliant without any external input,\nbut, having sufficient quantity of seed stock of the right variety needed for\nthe season is difficult. Selling seeds on a small scale is made more difficult\nby a number of laws that purport to maintain seed\nquality. So the farmer needs to maintain their own robust seed bank. Vialbility\nalso reduces when stored for multiple years, along with insects\nattacking the seeds. So the seeds need to be regularly replaced with fresh\nseeds from growing crops.\nI have started out with buying most of my seeds from the local agricultural\nsupply stores around Tindivanam. These are likely commercial varieties that\nmight be bred to take advantage of chemical inputs. I haven't tried\nheirloom seeds yet.\nI have been able to replenish my seed bank with my own seeds for mucuna and sunn hemp, but doing it for the\nfood crops like, green gram, cow pea etc. has been difficult as I end up storing\nthe seeds incorrectly leading to insect atack.\nGoing forward,\n\nI need a more disciplined storage method and a way to track their age.\nI need to study the characterstics of different varities of the same crop\nto select seeds suited for my climate, soil and the style of natural farming\nthat I perform.\n\n\n\nPest &amp; disease management through botanical ingredients\nI have not faced any significant crop loss due to pest attack, likely because,\nthe yield is already low due to other reasons. Also, it is said that, the pests\nattack only weak crops and when external\nfertilizers, either manure or artificial, is added, weak crops crowd out the\nfield over the hardy ones and later end up getting attacked by pests. This leads\nto significant crop loss compared to just letting these weak crops die early and\nletting the hardy crops provide a lower yield.\nHopefully I would be able to find right balance between the two.\n\n\nStrict NO to chemical inputs\nObviously this is the easist principle to follow if you aren't constrained by\nneeding high yields. In addition to saving money, chemicals like Glyphosate\nwhich is used as a weedicide, pose a risk to human health. Here I prefer using\nthe precautionary\nprinciple of not using a\ntechnique that has a risk of damaging\nhuman health than waiting for it to be proven.\n\n\nI have learnt a lot from studying APCNF. Using it as a framework for evaluating my\ncurrent practice has given me a confidence that I am going in the right path and\ngiven me a number of new ideas that I can try out and improve on. I now have a better\npicture of what my end goal looks like in my journey to grow food without using\nfossil fuels.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/apcnf/","title":"Andhra Pradesh Community managed Natural Farming"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/arappor-iyakkam/":{"body":"I recently started volunteering with Arappor Iyakkam,\nwhich is a civil society organization that fights for an accountable government.\nI had been following their work for the past 6 to 7 years, and now that I have\nsome time to spare, I decided to spend at least one day a week volunteering with\nthem.\nThe first activity that I participated was the audit of the tenders that were\ngiven out by the Greater Chennai Corporation for restoring water bodies. These\nwere for works like deepening the lake or pond and constructing bunds and\npathways around them.\nIt is well known that, the tenders given to contractors for public works are a\nmajor source of corruption, and it was heartening to see common citizens banding\ntogether to make sure our tax money is not wasted.\nI picked two water bodies viz. Karuppan Kulam and Vairavan Pond, both near\nAmbattur. As instructed by the coordinator I visited both the water bodies, took\nextensive photographs of the restoration work that was underway and also talked\nto a few residents to gather information on when the work carried out and\nsubmitted them.\nVolunteering with them has shown a glimpse of the extensive field work they do\nand the effort involved.\nOne gripe was that I did not receive enough visibility of the overall progress\nof the project. There was only one full time employee who coordinated all the\nvolunteers through WhatsApp. He was clearly overburdened, and I could not expect\nhim to worry about volunteer engagement.\nI am hoping to see more information on this campaign in the coming months and\nsee how effective it is.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/arappor-iyakkam/","title":"Arappor Iyakkam"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/breaking-into-a-car-and-duplicate-keys/":{"body":"When we bought our car, a Hyundai i10, in 2008, we received two keys and I was a\nhappy driver for 16 years. If we mistakenly left the keys inside and got\nourselves locked out of the car, the spare key saved the day.\nLast year, our car met with an accident and was towed away to the police\nstation. Fortunately no one was hurt. We all learn from our mistakes, and we\nbecome a slightly better driver after an accident. But this one also taught me\nlessons of a different kind.\nThis was on the day of a relative's engagement. The car that hit ours was a\nBolero pickup truck and didn't show any signs of impact other than a small dent\non its left bumper. But the Hyundai i10's front right side fender, wheel and\naxle where totalled.\nThe police didn't agree to let us tow the car to our place and wanted both\nparties to come to the station with the vehicle. In retrospect, I should have\ngone to the station along with the car and dealt with the matter the same day.\nBut I did not know better at that time and succumbed to the pressure to attend\nthe function. The situation was further muddied by assurances from the Panchayat\npresident of the nearby village, that I can deal with it the next day and didn't have\nto worry. He was also a relative.\nI soon realized that this was one of the stupidest thing to do. Showing the\nleast care for your property and trusting the police to protect it.\nWe sought the help of a lawyer, who negotiated with the police. It took a few\ndays for the police to confirm that the other party would not proceed with filing a\ncase and to agree to return the confiscated property.\nI eagerly went to the Police station along with the lawyer the same evening. I\nwas asked to write a letter with the details of the incident which included the\nstatement that the police have duly returned the confiscated vehicle, and I\nagreed to report back with the car if there was any further inquiry or action\nneeded.\nAll these were the regular procedure and the lawyer handling it made it less\nstressful for me. But unfortunately, after giving the letter, they searched for\nthe key, and it was nowhere to be found. We rummaged through two boxes full of\nkeys from vehicles with a similar plight. The police said that the person who\nwas on duty might have misplaced it, and he would be on duty only the next day.\nI would have to use the duplicate key until then.\nThe duplicate key was in Chennai and the car was in the Mailam police\nstation, a distance of 135 km. We\nhad already given the letter to the police before we were informed of the\nmissing key.  Refusing to pick up the car now and asking for the letter to be\nreturned would sour the matters, and cause more work for me. The lawyer too was\nin no mood to confront the police. Now that I remember the small talk he had\nwith the constables on first name basis, I realized he would be even less\ninterested than me in creating a ruckus.\nWe weighed our options for opening the door. The lawyer called one of his\njuniors, who conveniently also ran an automotive scrapyard. After a bit of small\ntalk with him, I made him realize that I was in no mood to scrap the car. He\nasked for a metal scale from the police station, tore of the weather stripping,\ninserted it between the door and the window glass and started playing around\nwith it trying to open the lock.\nMeanwhile, the guy who we had called to tow the car to a local garage, suggested\nthat he could either call up someone to pick the lock or just break the quarter\npane glass and open the car. As I was slowly weighing my options, the lawyer\nmade a more quick decision and asked the driver to call up the lock pickers. It\nwas already getting dark now.\nThree guys arrived at the scene on a Honda Activa and started randomly\ndisconnecting wires on the front and around the headlights.  Another guy started\nplaying around with the scale inserted in the window, replacing the junior\nadvocate.\nI felt like my car was being violated by five men and that blew my fuse off.\n\"Stop!\" I shouted. \"Why are you disconnecting the wires, without asking me?\nDon't you realize that there is no electronic theft device installed?\"\nI was angry at the thought that they might break other things while trying to\nopen the lock. I would be the one who would have to live with the consequences.\nThere was no way these people would prioritize my interests. They were here for\nthe easy money, that came from exploiting my helplessness. They didn't care\nabout reducing further loss to my property, but only about extracting the\nmaximum amount of money from me. It wasn't without reason that three people had\ncome to pick a single lock which did not require man power but skill, patience\nand focus. The closest situation to this I had faced was when my father had\ndeveloped a brain tumour.\n\"I know you are a bunch of amateurs. Get lost\", I shouted again.\nSince they had just begun to work, it was easier for me to kick them out with a\nbit more of posturing. Fortunately, they left without extracting any money from me.\nI asked the towing service driver to break the quarter pane. I had already\nchecked the price, and it was just around Rs. 600, including shipping.\nThe driver took a lever from his boot, gave quick wack on the glass with it, and\nsoon we were on our way to the garage, with the car in tow.\n\nFast-forward a few years, and I was once again in the same situation, this time\npurely my doing.\nOne day I was working on the front right door of our car after removing the door\ntrim. I was trying to replace the side view mirror which was knocked off its\nfixture. I couldn't remember how it happened. My best guess was the pesky\nneighbourhood kids, who I last saw playing ice-boy—now Americanized to\nhide-and-seek—running up and down the stairs beside which the car was parked.\nNow don't mistake me for an old curmudgeon\nWith a bit of guidance from a few YouTube videos, I soon completed the task.\nFeeling proud, I hurried to take a break.\nWhen I returned a few minutes later to clear up the tools, I couldn't open the\ndoor. I had forgotten to check the lock position before slamming the door shut,\nand the key was still in the ignition switch. What a stupid mistake I had done.\nThere are the occasions when you really wish you had a time machine so that you\ncan go back and kick your past self on their butt right when they are about to\ndo that one action which changes their lives.\nI stood there frozen, playing the events that happened in the last few minutes\nover and over in my mind. No one turned up with a time machine.\nI swallowed my pride and went through my options. I searched\nboodmo and the price was around Rs. 450. There was\nanother item already in the cart and showed a shipping charge of Rs. 150. I\nconcluded that the price was around the same that I had paid a year before and\ndecided to break into my car, once again.\nI tested a few items like a box spanner and screwdriver, hitting the quarter\npane with them. The glass was too strong, and all of them bounced back with just\na few scratches left on the glass. I realized I needed something more hefty and\nwith a sharp point. Immediately I remembered something that would do the work. I\nran into the house, got hold of a bill hook and tapped the pointed end on the\nglass, imagining all the Tamil movies I had watched. The pane shattered into a\nthousand little diamonds held together by cheap cellophane.\nWhile carefully removing the broken bits of glass from the seat and floor, I\nsilently vowed, to get the spare key made first before replacing the broken\nglass.\nI started with some quick research on the Internet and there were machines made\nby the ever innovative tool vendors from Coimbatore which duplicated a key onto\na blank by using a cutting disk that moved by tracing the original\nkey. There were also blank keys\nbeing sold for the i10 online that cost Rs. 300.\nI wished I could buy the cutting machine and make my own duplicate key, but at\nmy scale even a file set wouldn't be worth the returns on my money.\nBeing a locksmith required years of practice. You could see them on the\nroadsides setting shop with just a small vice, hacksaw and a file set. They had\nimmense skill and would whip out a duplicate key from the hundreds of blanks on\ndisplay, before you knew it. The quality of the fitting jobs I had done in the\nmechanical workshop at college were still fresh in my mind. I started to look\nfor a locksmith.\nI went to the round building\nshops,\na landmark around Mogappair, and a place filled with all manners of low\ninvestment trades. After a few enquiries, I located a locksmith's shop, but they\nall seemed to have been put out of work by the machine. They still had their\nshops, but now used them as price gouging fronts. They would tell that it would\ntake two days for the key to be made and take the key to another vendor who\nowned the duplicating machine. It had become a low turnover, high margin\nbusiness.\nI enquired with the person sitting lazily on a stool.\n\"OK, here talk to the owner\", he said. I took the phone and told my situation\nand asked how much a duplicate key would cost.\n\"I can quote only after seeing the car, Sir\", the locksmith replied.\nI told him the make, model and year and also said there were no electronic security\nsystem.\n\"It would cost Rs. 1800\", he replied.\n\"What? Why do you need so much for a simple key?\" I asked expressing my shock.\n\"Sir, there is a chip inside the key\", he replied.\n\"Really? This is what people told when the Rs. 2000 note was released\", I chuckled.\nThe locksmith was not pleased with my sense of humour.\n\"OK, I will call you once I get hold of the key. What is your name?\" I asked.\n\"Daniel\", he replied.\nAs I walked into the Tirumangalam Metro station I took a photo of the key and\nsent it to Daniel through WhatsApp. I boarded the next train to central on my\nway to GP Road.\nGP Road is right behind the famous LIC building and was the Mecca of original\nauto parts in Chennai. I was looking at all the sign boards placed in the shops,\nas I walked past, for any indication of key duplication services. Finally, I\nspotted a photo of a car key on a shop called Nachiappa\nStickers.\nThe name sounded familiar and looked like a reputed shop. I went inside and\nshowed the key to the attendant.\n\"There might be a chip embedded in the plastic moulding, Sir. In that case, the\nduplicate can be used only to open the door and will not start the engine. If\nyou also want to drive the car, you need to contact the dealer to get the key\",\nhe said.\n\"That is OK, how much does the duplicate cost?\" I asked.\n\"Rs. 150\", he replied.\nThis sounded a better deal. \"Go ahead and make me one\", I said handing over the\nkey.\nIn just under a minute, he came back with a new key with neatly cut grooves\nmatching the original.\n\"If it does not open, should I do any sanding or filing to fit it?\" I asked.\n\"No Sir, it will fit perfectly\", he replied.\nI then stopped at Jehangir where I\nhad bought the quarter pane glass earlier.\n\"It would cost Rs. 900\", the attendant replied.\nThis was way more than what I had budgeted after checking the price on boodmo.\n\"Is there any other cheaper option?\" I enquired.\n\"Try Pudupet\", he replied.\nPudupet is the other automotive Mecca, situated on the opposite side of the\nCooum river, from GP Road. It is famous for refurbished parts from old and more\nfamously stolen vehicles. I had driven through the place a few times but never\nhad a good look at the shops. I decided to pay my visits to this place too.\nAs I walked across the bridge, I saw the usual sewage flowing in the Cooum\nriver.  The stench was unbearable. The pilgrim's road is never comfortable.\nPudupet had a bit of an old world charm to it. After walking past some shops\nthere was this large shady tree. The kind under which a village headman would\nsit to decide a local dispute. A shed with its doors locked stood under it now.\nThe name board said, \"Police at door step\".\nAs I walked past, I couldn't see any shops specializing in glass. It was mostly\nreworked engines, exhausts, suspensions and lots of cheap new accessories. I\ndidn't want to waste time enquiring anywhere as I had already made up my mind\nthat it would be too much of a gamble buying from here.\nI walked a bit more and ended up at the Egmore railway station and boarded the\nmetro back to Tirumangalam.\nAs I got out of the metro, I received a voice message with a quote from Daniel.\n\"There is no chip in this key Sir. It will cost Rs. 550\", he said.  I posted\na 'Thank You' emoji, feeling happy on the savings I made.\nBack home, I logged into boodmo to order the glass, but it showed a shipping cost\nof Rs. 500 which brought the cost to Rs. 950. I cursed myself for assuming the\nshipping cost and the government for the inflation and started looking for any\nvendor closer to home.\nCalcutta Glass in Arumbakkam seemed\nto be the nearest store. I called the shop, and they quoted Rs. 950. This was\nstill a better option than boodmo as I didn't have to wait for 10 days, or so I\nthought. Instead, I ended up being cheated by this guy who sold me a piece with\na number of scratches. I realize now that I should have followed him when he\ntook the piece inside for packing. A common ruse in the big bad world outside of\nAmazon. Running to the shop once again for replacement that may or may not come,\nwasn't worth the time and money. I realize now why people vacillate towards\nAmazon even when it pulls up a few dirty tricks on its own.\nNow I am all set to attempt replacing the glass, without fear of locking myself\nout. No one would even guess that the glass was replaced as it looks as old as\nthe car with scratches that mimics age. More importantly I was thankful that I\ndid not have an engine immobilizer that requires the chip in the key to be\nreprogrammed, nor a car costly enough to require an engine immobilizer.\nInnovation is about selling a problem as a solution, so that you can keep\ninnovating.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/breaking-into-a-car-and-duplicate-keys/","title":"Breaking into a car and making duplicate keys"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/chargebacks-on-fastag/":{"body":"I have got a couple of chargebacks for less than Rs. 200 on my ICICI Fastag account,\nin the past few years.\nFor the first one I totally panicked and raised a ticket\non the online portal which requested for the RC copy to be attached.

For, you can develop infinite capacity to\nnot do things, but are limited by time on the things to do.\nHere is ChrisFix's own advice on what not to do when cleaning your cars:\n\nAnd here is the daily bath routine I follow for my car:\n\nTake two buckets of clean tap water.\nTake a clean, washed micro fiber towel.\nRinse it in the first bucket of water.\nFold it as many times as required to get a surface area that is size of the\npalm of your hand so that you can use it comfortably.\nClean your car in straight motions, picking up the dust and dirt and leaving a clean surface.\nClean the top part of the car first and then move to the bottom areas which is dirtier.\nAs the area of the towel gets dirty, change the fold to expose a portion that\nis not soiled yet and use it. Once one side of the towel is all used up, you can\nchange to the back side and fold it as before and use it.\nOnce both side are dirty, rinse in the first bucket of water, and then another time in the second bucket.\nOnce the water in the first bucket turns dirty enough, usually around 2\nrinses, Refill it and use it as the second bucket, while the earlier second\nbucket with the less dirty water, becomes the first.\n\nUsually I am able to clean a car that is standing for a week without use, using\ntwo to three rinses of the towel and four buckets of water. I have used this\ntechnique for the better part of 15 years and I am really impresed with the\nshine that still remains on my car.\nIf you are still here with me and this kind of thing excites you, move on to ChrisFix's\nmagnum opus — How to Super Clean Your Car:\n\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/cleaning-your-car/","title":"Cleaning your car"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/clearing-sewage-mains/":{"body":"\nI have used the technique I have described at the end, a couple of more times. Now I am starting to proactively check and do the treatment every year to avoid the surprise.\n\nWhen we reconstructed our house, we decided to reuse the existing sewage connection. We were fed up with the bribes that we kept paying right from getting building plan approval to tea money for the local beat constable. We didn't want to once again pay the councillor and other metro water officials for a new connection.\nSince this was an old line, it was more than probably 10 feet under the ground level. We had the option to either make the sewage chamber deep enough so that the outlet pipe enters horizontally into the chamber or make the chamber less deep, and use a long bend to make the outlet line enter vertically into the chamber like an L.\nHaving heard of labourers getting asphyxiated when entering sewage chambers to clear a clog, I decided to go for the second option, i.e. reduce the depth of the chamber and instead use a vertical pipe for the remaining depth. This unfortunately was not the right thing to do–because clearing any clog becomes difficult. The device used to clear the clog is a series of mild steel rods that are screwed along in a chain and has a bit of flex, but does not curve tight enough for it to pass through the long bend. On the other hand, if the outlet pipe is horizontal, the larger dimensions of the chamber opening provides a sufficient bend radius for the clog clearing rod to be inserted.\nAnother problem was that, the old line did not connect to the nearest mains chamber on our street, but used an older pipeline that likely joined a chamber further down on the main road.\nIn 2024, we ended up with our first clog with the sewage overlowing from the chamber during heavy inflow during the mornings. We called a few private people, on the recommendation of a metro water worker, who regularly visits houses to add chlorine to the water sumps. They unfortunately did not have the right tools and were not able to do clear the line.\nNext we went to the local metro water office, where there was a register to enter complaints about blocked sewage lines. We added the entry there and the worker on watch helpfully gave chlorine tablet to add to overhead tank. The sewage workers came in two days and said, since the block is in the line to our house we had to pay them separately for the work. With the situation we were in, we agreed to pay what they asked.\nAs they prepared to start work, I broke the news on the vertical entry of the sewage pipe. On hearing this, they complained that this is going to make their work difficult. \"The pipe should always be horizontal\", they declared. I told them reasoning for the decision that I had took. \"Why do you worry Sir, however deep the chamber is, we will enter it to clear the line\", they said. Given our predicament, we asked what the options were.\nThey asked for a big waste cloth and screwed it on to the segmented rod that they use for clearing the lines. Now using the cloth as a plunger, they inserted it into the pipe. The pipe was under a few feet of sewage that was standing in the chamber. Now, they used a pumping action to oscillate the water in the pipe which miraculously dislodged the clog and the water began to drain.\nAfter a week, we saw sewage, once again, stagnate in the chamber and panicked. Given that it was not sustainable to call the sewage workers every week, I decided to take the problem into my own hands. I checked out a number of YouTube videos on clearing sewage lines. There were a number of techniques, but the simple chemical solution ala Drainex seemed to be the simplest for my skill and equipment level.\nMy theory was that, the clog was due to fat deposits that had not fully dissolved and had once again coalesced to reduce the flow. I had read about Sodium Hydroxide aka Caustic Soda beind used as a chemical agent to dissolve fat deposits clogging sewage pipes. This costed around Rs. 90 per kg vs Rs. 500 per kg for something like Drainex. \nI added around 1 kg of caustic soda and a bucket of hot water to the chamber before going to sleep. First thing in the morning, I eagerly opened the chamber to see the state. It had been around 6 hours from the time I had started the treatment. Now the water had drained completely from the chamber.\nHopefully I can now maintain the sewage connection for life without having to get a new one.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/clearing-sewage-mains/","title":"Clearing Sewage Mains"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/climate-spiral/":{"body":"I was searching for a nice way to visualize historical rainfall data in my farm and stumbled upon this scary visualization from NASA:\n\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/climate-spiral/","title":"Climate Spiral"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/darebee-healthy/":{"body":"After an acute spike in my blood sugar in November 2020, I embarked on a strict\nprocess involving keto diet, intermittent fasting and strength training\nexercises. More than 5 years before that, I was diagnosed with fatty liver which\nI largely ignored and was visibly overweight, reaching 90 kgs. After the\nintervention, I probably lost around 20 kg of weight and 4 inches in waist size\nover a period of around a year.\nExercise was indispensible part of this process. Cost many times does indicate\nquality, but when it comes to knowledge and learning, it is always a contra\nindicator. What is costly is priced for the easy path shown to acheive a metric, which by requirement needs to be easily measured. But these metrics are only a proxy for the outcome that you desire, which only time can reveal. I was always wary of buying education. \nI viewed my exercise journey as an education process and decided to seek out\nhigh quality sources which aren't manufactured specifically to sell to me.\nI started with Rowen Row's channel on Youtube with mostly following this no equipment exercise routine.\n\nAfter a few months I wanted a bit more of variety and started on a 28 day\nfitness program based on videos by a person called Ashley\nConrad.\nI still remember not being able to stand on one leg without holding on to a support when doing the standing quadricep\nstretch.\nIt is likely an early indicator of the neural damage which can lead to\nParkinson' disease. After more than 3 years of practise, I have gained my\nbalance.\nOne of the real world uses of strength is in fights and Mixed Martial\nArts or MMA piqued my\ninterest. I enjoyed watching the fights and read through The Ultimate Mixed\nMartial Arts Training\nGuide\nby Dann Plyler. This talked more about the philosophy and techniques used. The book,\nTrainig for\nWarriors by\nMartin Rooney had a bit more on exercise routines and I diligently practised them\nfor a few months.\nAs with any good habit, it is easy break a streak and getting back on track is\ndifficult. I often lose interest and many times my thrifty thought of \"exercise\nis a waste of time and resources and instead I should rely more on manual work\",\ntakes over. Also now that I am in a far better shape, I am no longer motivated\nenough to do the strenuous 1 hour sessions I used to do.\nThis is when the DAREBEE website helps a lot. I found\nthis a year back and it was my next stop after the MMA encounter. DAREBEE has bite\nsized pages that focus on a specific theme and has  multiple difficulty levels.\nThese can also be conveniently downloaded as a PDF to help refer during\nexercises, wherever you are. Now that I am familiar with the basic movements and\ntheir functions, I no longer need complete videos. The wide\nvariety of the exercise collection and the interesting gamification in some of\nthem all help sustain the streaks.\nAlso whenever I am in this mixed mood of not wanting to exercise but also\nfeeling awful because I am not, I push myself to do 10 squats\nand 10 pushups before my morning bath. This often helps me get back on\nmy streak.\nA word of  caution: most body weight exercises have very little risk of injury\ncompared to external weights. But always listen to your body and not over exert.\nDo sufficient warmup before your exercise and have sufficient breaks and rest\ndays, during and after\nthe exercise. You will hear this a lot from everyone, but it cannot be over\nemphasized.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/darebee-healthy/","title":"Darebee healthy"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/datastructures-on-hypercore-queue/":{"body":"In the previous post we saw how we can\nimplement a stack on a hypercore.

I will be exploring them in a series of\nposts.\nIn this post, we will see the representation of a stack with diagrams\nrepresenting the state after each step of a series of operations.\nEach rectangle represents a block in the Hypercore. The number above it\nrepresents the block number. Hypercore allows blocks to be only added.\nSo the block number increases monotonically. Also, there is no way to\nremove a block. So You will see the total Hypercore size increases as\nwe progress.\nStep 1\nThe initial state is an empty Hypercore which represents an empty stack.\nOn pushing an element into the stack, we ad a new block with the element\nadded.\n\nStep 2\nNow we push another.\n\nStep 3\nNow we want to pop the top element. Till now, the top element of the stack\nhas been the the last block in the Hypercore, but now need to change the\ntop of the stack. We do this by writing the block number of the top\nelement as a new block.\n\nTill now a block had only the contents of the stack. Now we have an\nadditional data type that a block can hold which is the block number\nof the top element or a pointer to the top. So you might need a type\nfield as the first byte of the block in your implementation, but we\nskip it for simplicity as our block contents are always an alphabet.\nAlso, the block number 2 is shown in gray as any further operations will\nnever access block number 2. This enables sparse download of the Hypercore\nfor an new comer or garbage collection of unused blocks for an existing\nuser.\nStep 4\nNext we push a new element C. We once again do this by appending a new\nblock with the element.\n\nStep 5\nNow we want to pop an element from the stack. Since the last block\ncontains the element directly and is not a pointer we directly read\nthe value of the top. Now we need to append a block to the Hypercore\nwith the block number of the previous element in the stack. We do this\nby looking at the previous block and if it is an element, we write its\nblock number as the new top. If instead it is a pointer we write that\nas the new top. In this case, we write the pointer value 1.\n\nStep 6\nNow a final pop to empty the stack.\n\nWe read the element A using the top pointer in the last block. Since\nthere is no previous block, we write the value 0 as the pointer to the\ntop by appending a new block. You will see that, now the beginning\npart of the Hypercore never needs to be downloaded by new users\nwho are interested only in the latest state.\nStep 7\nNow we will see how the stack looks with a new element inserted after\nthe stack has been emptied.\n\nI hope this figure is now self explanatory.

In local parlance it is known as Karambu. The only plant life that was there was Bermuda grass. This seemed like the poorest state a land can be in, with whatever that grew, immedately being plundered by voracious cows and goats.\nWhenever I dig an area of the grass, I still see earthworms nestled in the root and stolon mat of the Bermuda grass. It seems like there is a symbiotic relationship between them and the grass supplies some highly valued food like sugars that the earthworms like. Or it could just be that, below the top few inches where the grass roots and stolons are present, the soil is highly compacted and the earthworms are simply not able to burrow down and move.\nOver the November-December rain season of 2023, I had a crop of horse gram which unfortunaetely died due to water stagnation and some of the beds were completely overrun by Bermuda grass. But I could see better earthworm signs after growing the cover crop. I saw mounds of pelletted soil in some places, which are likely worm castings. These are said to improve the macro structure of the soil and reduce compaction. Earthworm tunnels were everywhere which were totally absent when there was just Bermuda grass. Also, I spotted a few earthworm nests with around 10 to 15 eggs or cocoons.\nAll these seem like good signs and I hope to have better crop in January because of the earthworms' work.\nHere is a video which shows how earthworms turn plant waste to good soil.\n\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/hello-earthworm/","title":"Hello earthworm"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/hello-world/":{"body":"Hello world!\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/hello-world/","title":"Hello world"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/income-tax-refund/":{"body":"Not sure if this is obscure, but I had to google to find out this page which\ngives the status of income tax refund for each assessment year:\nhttps://tin.tin.nsdl.com/oltas/refund-status-pan.html\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/income-tax-refund/","title":"Check status of income tax refund"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/install-rust-for-all-users/":{"body":"So, I wanted a single rust compiler to be installed system wide, but the\ndefault result of using rustup is, it is installed\nlocally in the current user's home directory.\nAfter a bit of searching on the Internet and some dead ends, I stumbled on\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/1085 which seems to be mostly working.\nInteresting thing I learned from the above is that, the script that was\nsuggested for 'rustc' can simply be symlinked to other commands like 'cargo'\nand it still works as it uses some\nparameter expansion\nmagic.\nAlso for whatever reason I had to do a sudo rustup component add rust-src\nto make rust-analyzer work with Visual Studio Code.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/install-rust-for-all-users/","title":"Install Rust for all users"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/keeping-up-with-youtube-channels/":{"body":"All Youtube channels have a subscribe button, but\nthere is no good way for me to consume the videos from the channels once I have\nsubscribed to them.\nYoutube does show a list of all the subscribed channels on the left side bar.

But these become unweildy, once I have more\nthan a couple of subscriptions.\nAt any time, I am in the mood to watch videos only from a specific topic, while\nthe one-big-list has all of them mixed together. Channels that release videos\nmore frequently clutter the feed. This totally frustrates me.\nYoutube forces me to use the home screen where an algorithm or more likely an AI\nselects what videos I can watch next. These videos are not just from the\nchannels I have subscribed, but a mish mash of videos that may or may not\ncontain new videos from my subscriptions. Interestingly, there are automatically\nchosen topics using which I can filter the videos in the home screen, but they\nnever match how I want to group them.\nDoes Youtube know about these problems? Most likely. But I guess none of the\nProduct Managers and UX Designers at Youtube would dare to do anything about them.\nFixing them would basically mean giving more control to the viewers and power to\nthe channels through the direct connection it provides. Youtube as an intermediary,\nwould lose its ability to monopolize the video streaming market. \nThe power that Youtube gets is turned directly into quarterly revenue. The\nAI that decdes what videos I can watch next hyper-optimizes for the hours that I\nspend on watching videos rather than what is good for my life. Google, Youtube's\nparent would care less. Google as a company would rather kill its customers and\nthemselves in the long run, rather\nthan leave some revenue on the table in the short\nterm.\nThe side effect of this power is the addiction that it afflicts on the viewers\nand the arbitrary censorship that it ends up doing as it editorializes the home\nscreen. This has been the pattern not just for Youtube, but Facebook and Twitter\ntoo. I hear, newer video platforms like TikTok have simply foregone even the\nillusion of a subscription mechanism.\nGoogle once had this motto called \"Don't be\nevil\" which looks like has long\nbeen officially removed. The trust and good will that Google had in its initial\ndays has been sold to the highest bidders. Products like the Google\nReader are created and maintained\nto choke other alternatives and suddenly sunset, once they have served their\npurpose. \nIn such a hostile environment, there are still some places of refuge.\nOne of them which I have personally used and like is the\nNewPipe Android app. This allows to search and browse\nvideos from channels and also group your subscriptions based on topics, so that,\nyou can have a more focussed video session catching up on a specific topic. I\nstill would like a few improvements on the video feed screen, but since it is\nopen source, I should be able to add them myself. Or I could even create my own\napp using the\nNewPipeExtractor library,\nwhich is part of the same project and used by NewPipe.\nSince NewPipe is not very amenable to Google's designs, it is not allowed on the\nofficial Play store. But you can still install it directly from their\nwebsite or from the F-Droid app\nstore as explained in their home page. It might sound\ndaunting at first for someone who is not tech savy, but I promise, it is worth\nthe effort.\nNewPipe also does not display any ads that you would see with the official\nYoutube app or the website. This obviouly means, the channels lose the potential\nrevenue. This may sound like a bad thing, but in the long run, the high quality\nchannels will survive as people would be more willing to direcly fund them\nthrough their website or other means.

This was at K. P. Park on De Mellows Road in Pulianthope that is also famous for the abysmal plastering and finishing work for which Arappor Iyakkam had previously raised a complaint with DVAC.\nAll the volunteers had gathered at the meeting point, and we could see the towering buildings painted in bright inviting colors, looking better than I had imagined. We entered the site and went into the nearest block. The more experienced volunteers immediately chose to survey the lifts, since it had become a concern after a person lost his life inside it due to an accident around a year back.\nWe approached the lift operator who was quite friendly and he told that only one of the lifts was working. The other one had not been funcitoning for the past 3 months. A quick enquiry with other residents waiting for the lift and we got numbers like 1.5 years. The lifts in the next block we visited was in a worse situation. The operator said only one of the two lifts functioned. But when we tried to press the button to summon the lift, he said, \"Sir, wait, I will go to the second floor and bring it down. The button doesn't work\". Yes, he was telling the truth. The lift works. Only the button doesn't work.\nThese towers had something like 10 to 12 floors and lifts were absolutely essential. Only one of the towers we visited had a working generator backup. The other one was supposedly under repair after rats chewed away the wires. This was on a Sunday evening and I can only imagine the chaos during rush hours on a working day.\nAs we came down the stairs from the 10th floor, we saw the other stark problem of K. P. Park. Garbage was strewn all over the stair case. We continued descending, placing each step with caution. Suddenly we stepped on a landing that was unusually clean. Someone wise, had pasted a wall paper with Mother Mary holding Baby Jesus in her hands. A makeshift shrine on the vertical roadways of K. P. Park.\nComing down we couldn't stop noticing garbage that followed us everywhere we looked. The OTS areas were the most affected with more than a dozen rats making a happy meal out of it.\nTalking to the residents, we came to know that the conservancy workers clean it every day, but it gets filled very soon by residents in the top floors dropping their daily waste directly out of their windows. There have also been accidents where someone had inadvertently stepped under such a falling bag. The conservancy workers have all been given helmets to safe guard their heads as they go about cleaning the area.\nWe had learnt in the audit pre-brief that many of the TNUHDB tenements had Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) that ran the maintenance and were also responsible for spending the fund allocated by the Government. At K. P. Park, none of the blocks had one.\nThere also seemed to be vertical segregation happening with the less previlieged people relocated recently from nearby areas like Egmore allocated residences on the top floors. While the people who had been living in the previous settlement that had been demolished to build this highrise, put up in the lower floors. One of the residents put the blame for the garbage squarely on \"...those uncivilized people living on the top floors. What can the government do?\".\nI wondered if mixing less privileged people across all floors would help the situation. But the same forces that end up pushing people dispersed througout the city into this single town within a city, are also likely oprating within this town.\nI wondered if mixing the less previliged people across all the floors would help the situation.

They\nprovide this for Maths and Science subjects from Class VI to XII. This is\nreally valuable for preparing for the exams and are used by both kids and\nteachers.\nUnfortunately, the website provides only individual PDF files for each chapter.\nAlso, the PDF file is a pre-production version with paper size markings which\nincreases the page size.\nAll of these make it difficult to read on a small ereader and the kids get\nanother reason to use the computer and eventually get distracted by the umpteen\ngames and Youtube videos that can also be accessed from there.\nI needed a way to combine the individual PDFs into a single file and also crop\nthe pages. There are a number of ways of doing this, but after a few trial and\nerrors, I settled on the excellent PDF\nArranger tool. I also did a print\nto PDF as a final step on my Gnome desktop and selected the option to 'fit to\npage', so that, all the pages have the standard A4 size, instead of the\ncropped sizes.\nI had the final PDF now, which I loaded onto my Kindle. The text was readable,\nbut it was still a subpar experience. My 7th Gen\nKindle,\nbought in 2015 was showing its age.\nSo I ended up creating A5 size books by\nimposing two of the original pages\non an A4 paper using the Book Binder tool. I used\nthe chain stitch that is explained in this\nvideo.\nWith some additional help from a few scraps of card board, an old jeans, a chart paper and\nFevicol, I now had a decent book whose binding was way better than commercially\nproduced books, because the book can be laid flat due to using small bundles of\npages that are stitched together called Signature.

The obvious solution at\nthat time was to switch from Clinic Plus to Head and Shoulders for my weekly\nhair wash, which we called, the head-bath. The day of the head-bath, everything\nlooked spick-and-span, but the next day, my whole head was filled with scales of dead skin. Soon, my favourite\npastime became, taking a newspaper and combing my dandruff onto it and\nwondering in bewilderment at the amount of skin I had shed. Applying coconut oil\nmade the flakes gooey, like oversoaked breakfast cereal. Skipping it made it\nlook fresh, ready to be thrown it into a bowl.\nLittle did I know, that, the shampoo was making the problem worse, by taking away\nthe natural oil layer secreted by the skin. The skin panics on detecting this loss and secretes more\nof its oil, which becomes a bumper food supply for the fungus on our skin, which\ngrow exponentially, triggering the skin cells to molt\nin profusion. Ignorant of this complexity,\nI increased the frequency of shampoo use and ended up with just a bigger\ndandruff mound on the newspaper.\nThis is when, I came across a video by Dave\nHakkens' which introduced me to\nthe No Poo movement.\nI stopped using shampoo, or for that matter even our traditional alternatives\nlike shikakai. Instead I started washing my hair daily with just plain water and\nalso skipped applying coconut oil, in an attempt to deprive the fungus of fatty oils. After a few months things looked better. The\nabsence of, the day-after-the-head-bath flare-up, itself, was a big relief. I have continued this with\ngood success for maybe 10 years now.\nThis is also the period when I slowly moved away from hot water to unheated water\nfor bathing. This also likely helped reduce the stress on the skin as hot water\ncan remove natural skin oils more, than cold water.\nCold water for bathing was something that I dreaded from my childhood. There was\nthis children's magazine called Wisdom where I had read\nthat bathing in cold water is the best for the human body. In spite of this, I\ncould never make this a habit.\nStarting from my home to my college in Pondicherry was a 3 hour journey that I\nused to make almost every week and invariably it was a Monday morning. I had to\nbath at around 4:30 AM, and hot water was what I used. Even then, by the time I\nreached college, I had sweated so much during the bus journey, that I felt \nuncomfortable sitting in the class, I even started walking all the way to the\nhostel to take a cold shower and walked back to the college, sometimes being\nlate or skipping the first hour. During this time I\ntried experimenting with taking bath in cold water instead of hot water,\nbefore I started from home on the bus journey. Remarkably I sweated much less\nand felt more fresh when I reached college.\nEven with this, first-hand proof, it was more than 10 years later, that cold\nshowers became a habit.\nAnother thing I started skipping during this time, was, using bathing soap. I know, this\nmight be shocking and you might feel uneasy coming close to me, after knowing\nthis fact, but no one has complained to me, yet.\nSimilar to the No Poo process, I do not use any traditional replacements like\nmoong dal powder or the other umpteen things which people have suggested.\nInitially I just used dried ridge gourd\nsponge to scrub my skin, but after a few months I started using it less\nfrequently. Now, I use the soap or the scrub very rarely, only in case I want to remove things like\noil, glue, paint or cement that are stuck to my skin. Otherwise, I just make good use of my hand\nfingers and nails and in the process realizing how inflexible my hands were in\nreaching my back. I also made good use of the towel I used to dry myself and\nfelt that the soap is better used on it than my body.\nWith the daily cold water head-bath regimen running successfully, I did notice\nthat there was still some amount of dandruff and I realized, the daily head bath\nmay not be necessary. So now, I have switched to just a weekly head bath or sooner if I felt they were dirty. In\naddition, I apply a bit of coconut oil on the hair after the head bath, as it\nreduces the oil secreted by my scalp even more and keeps the fungus under\ncontrol. Now everything seems to be in a steady state.\n\"Wow, so, are the people who invented shampoo and soaps, fools?\" I hear people ask.\nIf they have no use, how did they\nget so popular? I suppose, they served a very narrow purpose when they were\ninvented. These were likely game changing and so they became popular, but soon they were being used even when they\nwere not necessary. Shampoo and soap are still the most advertised products on\ntelevision, serving very much as a proof that, only unnecessary products are\nadvertised. Antibiotics, paracetamol, sugar, fertilizers, the over-used-products list may just be growing.\nI still fancy myself thinking, the marketing team of Procter and Gamble got word\nof my findings and has spent crores of rupees on this\nad to shame me back into using their\nproduct. \"Dandruff thirumba varave varathu\", they plead, with the sincerity of a\ncar salesman.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/no-poo/","title":"No poo and some more"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/passwords/":{"body":"Passwords are the simplest way for remote services to authenticate us and they\nare ubiquitous.

When I was a kid, I fancied myself starting a lending library and catalogued all the books in my house, but atleast, I ended up reading almost all of them.\nWith the distractions available to today's kids, books are their least preferred form of entertainment. They do get books from the neighborhood lending library, but they seem to be atleast 5 years behind the kind of books that they should be reading for their age.\nPublic libraries as a concept is very noble, but they may sound irrelevant when you can get almost the entire world's knowledge on the Internet. But no ebook can beat the physical book in terms of the humane interface they provide and continue to be costly for a voracious reader. Public libraries make this luxury, something that everyone can enjoy.\nI decided to visit they Public libraries in Chennai to see their state and make them one of the places that my kids go by themselves to in the City.\nDistrict Central Library\nThis was the first public library that I went to, as a kid, in the 1990s. It had atleast 3 floors of books, then, and also a kids section. Now when I visited it in 2023, it was reduced to just the ground floor and the place looks totally run-down. The books were dusty and the collection was very poor. Many books were also marked as reference only. Looked like the budget has been severly cut and / or the books moved to other libraries.\nEveryone is allowed to enter this library and read books as a visitor. You just need to sign the register at the entrance. The membership cost is less than Rs. 100 per year and you can take 4 books for 2 weeks that you can extend twice or thrice over the phone. For membership, you just need to provide an identity proof and an address proof in Chennai. Aadhar card or driving license should work.\nIf you find some books that interest you, this might still be worth a membership.\nLocation: 735, Anna Salai, Near TVS Bus Stop, Anna Salai, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600002.

There were atleast 4 floors of books with a decent collection that are also available for lending. Overall this looked to be the best option for someone living in north Chennai.\nAnyone can visit the library and read books. You just need to sign the register at the entrance. The membership requires you to be a resident of Chennai and also have the form attested by a gazetted officer or a notary public. A bit onerous but looks to be worth it.

It would have been redeemed if there were more classics and best sellers from the US, but all the books and magazines seemed to be dated and obscure.\nEveryone is allowed to enter the library and read books. You need to bring a valid, original photo ID like a driving license, that should be submitted at the security check along with your mobile phone.

The clerk and the officer were trying to genuinely\ncomplete the process, though hampered by inefficient systems and their lack\nof skill.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/trouble-with-sarathi/","title":"Trouble with Sarathi"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/vacant-land-tax/":{"body":"In the year 2017, the Chennai Corporation (later called Greater Chennai\nCorporation or GCC), started imposing a tax on vacant land within its\nboundaries. This was to discourage land hoarders—and more importantly, to\nincrease their revenue.\nA simple way to pass on generational wealth that was accessible to the common\nman, became less economical. It might be justified if the government did a\nbetter job of enforcing land grabbing laws in the city, but it is not the case.\nPolice for their part, in cahoots with the politicians impose their own tax.\nThe vacant land tax seems to have been initiated by other urban bodies in Tamil\nNadu, and the other states too, around the same time.\nI had inherited one such parcel of land in 2008 and had to pay my dues, before I\ncould exercise my rights to develop it. But as usual, this straight forward\ntask was made needlessly tedious, by our government officers and politicians,\nand an opportunity for them to profit.\nThe Chennai Corporation's Revenue Department has very detailed information on\ntheir website explaining all their procedures\nand the formula for calculating the vacant land tax. Along with the Basic\nStreet Rate (BSR), for zone\n13\nI was able to get an idea of the tax I would have to pay.\nI also found a document explaining the SOP for all revenue department\nprocedures and\nanother document giving the SOP specifically for new assessment of property\ntax.\nThe process for vacant land tax assessment was essentially the same as any\nregular property tax assessment that you make for a built house or any other\nstructure.  The entire process had an SLA of 30 days. There was also a website\nwhere an online application can be made for the\nassessment, in\naddition to other services.\nSo far, so good, and I was happy with our Digital India!\nI completed the form and tried to submit the application, and I got a 502\nerror—looks like our officials had managed to sabotage the online process. What\nis advantageous for the citizen, is likely, not so for them.\nThere was a paper form for new tax assessment that came up in search results,\nbut it had umpteen columns and details, that I decided to go to the zonal\noffice in Adyar to enquire. I have\ntoo many scars from my engineering college days, when highly educated lab staff\nwould throw my meticulously crafted record out, for not having used the same format\nas my seniors. Yes, they too had a government job, and they knew it comes with\nsome perks—no one can take it away from them.\nOne Monday, I reached LB Road in Adyar and walked past a\nBolero and a\nFortuner to enter into the\noffice on the ground floor. I grew an inch shorter as I realized, no one really\ncared what entered their office. Everyone where busy with their work. I felt\nlike a ghost, or should I say, the invisible man?\nI slowly assessed who might be least annoyed, when I disturb them. Sitting right\nnext to the entrance was a person, slightly older than me, looking busily at\nsome files—I decided he would be my best bet.\n\"Sir, I want to enquire about vacant land tax...\", I said, approaching him. He\ncut me off replying, \"Give the letter to him\". He was pointing to the desk in\nthe centre of the room. There were a few people standing there and one of them\nwas doing all the talking. Happy that I did not take more of the officer's\nprecious time, I approached the clerk.\n\"No, no form. Just give a letter.\", he said. \"Attach a copy of the sale deed and\npatta. And don't forget to attach the EC\". EC stood for Encumbrance Certificate,\na document that provides the list of transactions pertaining to a specific\nsurvey number. Proud that I already knew that, I returned home.\nOnly then it struck me, that I did not know, whom the letter needs to be\naddressed to. I went through the documents that I had, and the SOP mentioned the\nAssistant Revenue Officer in a number of places—I decided he was my man.\n\nHere is the format of the letter I had\nused, in case you find it useful. Use\nLibreOffice to open and edit.\n\nI put all the documents in a green, cloth-lined envelope and carried an\nadditional copy of the letter that I could get dated, stamped and signed by the\nclerk as an acknowledgement. This is the SOP that needs to be followed when\nsubmitting documents to the government—I had learnt this from my father.\n\"What Sir, should I do all the work? Take the letter out of the envelope and\ngive it to me. Write your name and phone number on the top\", said the letter\nclerk when I gave it to him.\n\"Yes, sure\", I removed the documents, underlined my name and phone number\nthat were already there on the letter and handed them to him. I was\nproud of my forethought, \nThe letter clerk duly dated, stamped and signed my acknowledgement copy.\n\"Sir, when will it be ready?\" I asked sheepishly.\n\"Sir is in a meeting. He will call you\", he replied. I glanced furtively at the\ndesignation on the board outside Sir's room. It said—Assistant Revenue Officer.\nAfter submitting the letter, I waited for 2 more weeks. I did not have much hope\nfor any SMS as mentioned in the SOP. But I wanted at least, half of the SLA to\nbe past, before I ask for the status—I didn't want to annoy the officers.\nI went to the Zonal office once again and enquired with the letter clerk.  \"Sir,\njust left now. All the officers are having a meeting in the Ripon building. You\ndo one thing. Call this number. He is the assessor. He will tell you the\namount\", he replied.\nI called the assessor, and he asked to come by the local corporation office at\nBrindavan Nagar Main Road the next day. When I reached there, only his assistant\nwas present.\n\"What is the area?\", he grabbed the calculator lying on his desk.\n\"Yes, tax will be for the entire 7 years\", he proceeded to calculate the amount\nand pointed to the numbers that showed up on its liquid crystal display.\n\"You have to give a DD for the amount. Only after you give the DD, we can enter\ninto the system. Call Sir.  He will tell you the correct amount.\", he concluded.\nI thanked him and moved to a bench away from his desk and called the assessor.\n\"Did you send the letter by post?\", he asked. \"Ah… OK. I haven't received the\ndocuments yet from Adyar. I will call you once I get it.\", he said, ending the\ncall.\nI went back home, nervously waiting for the call. The assessor called after a few\ndays.\n\"What is the plot number? Where does the Sri Krishna Nagar come?\", he asked.\n\"Sir, it is an unapproved layout and your department is no longer using the\noriginal name.\", I replied.\n\"OK, can you submit a copy of the parent sale deed where the plot number is\nmentioned?\"\n\"Yes\", I replied.\nThe day after, I took the document copies to the Brindavan Nagar Main Road\noffice and gave it to the assistant. \"Sir, is in Velachery office. I will give\nit to him, when he comes by\", he said.\nAfter some chit-chat, he hinted, \"I don't know when the assessor will come. If\nyou want, I can go and give the documents in Velachery today itself.\"\nI sensed in his voice, the hope of making a few hundred rupees to indulge in his\nfavourite vice. I was not going to fall for his sweet talk. \"Sir said, he will\ncollect it when he comes by\", I replied firmly.\n• • •\n\"Your tax will be Rs. 23,200\", the assessor finally called around a week later,\nquite late in the evening. \"Bring a DD for the amount tomorrow.\", he reminded.\nThis was the same amount that the clerk showed on the calculator. Until now, I\nhad not given any bribe to the assessor. Neither did he ask for it. I wanted to\nsee, how far I could hold.\nBut, why did he ask for a DD? The SOP clearly said that the assessor would raise\nthe notice for tax with the bill number, and we could pay it through a number of\nchannels including, online payment or swipe a card at one of the ward offices.\nThe amount that I had to pay was significant.\n\"What if the assessor misused the DD or delayed the process after I give it to\nhim?\", I asked my mom in trepidation.\n\"Government officers will not do such things\", she assured.\nThis sounded very naive, but 35 years of experience in the education department\nof the Tamil Nadu State Government, should count for something.\n\"He will write your name and the bill number in the back of the DD\", she\nassured. This sounded like a better advice.\n\"I will write my name myself\", I said, happy that the DD cannot be\nmisused to pay tax for someone else.\nThe assessor could still, simply deny receiving the DD, while still raising the\nbill. But this would only be an attempt to spite me, and he could not personally\nprofit from it.\nStill, I decided to leave nothing to chance. \"I will take a photo copy of the DD and\nget it signed by the assessor as an acknowledgement\", I declared.\nThe next day, I took the DD and hurried to the corporation office and\nforgot to take a photo copy and also to write my details in the back of the DD.\nHow stupid of me.\nThe assessor took the DD, wrote my name and phone number in the back and put it\nin his drawer. \"The bill will be ready in a day or two. You will receive an SMS.\nYou can come and collect the receipt from the office.\"\nHe did not hint on any bribe, but his demeanour was cold and impersonal.\nI was still cursing myself for not having taken a photo copy and was a little\nworried. But decided to leave it at this and call the assessor only after a\ncouple of days. Soon, I got busy with other work and on the second day, I got a\ncall from the assessor.\n\"Your bill is ready. Collect it from the Velachery corporation office\", he said.\n\"Yes, it is near the Dhandeeswaram temple in Velachery.\", he further directed.\nI was familiar with the place but never knew that a corporation office existed\nthere. I asked a local person on reaching the place, and he pointed to the\nbuilding, which is not easy to miss, once you start looking for it.\nGoing inside the building, past the trees, I saw a typical government office,\nwith a building in faded yellow, or was it blue? I cannot remember. There was a\nshed being repaired in the front.\nThe assessor was sitting behind a counter with a computer. \"This must be his\nprimary work location\", I said to myself. He was on the phone with someone, but\non seeing me, he printed a copy of the bill, stamped and signed it, while\nstill multitasking on the phone.\n\"I missed adding the late fee. You need to pay that also\", he said after\nfinishing the phone call. It amounted to a few hundred rupees.\n\"Can I pay it by cash?\", I asked.\n\"There is no work for cash after this. Everything is online. If you have a card,\nyou can swipe in the machine here\", the assessor replied, pointing to the desk\nby his side.\nI took out my debit card and gave it to his assistant who was at the swiping\nmachine.\nFeeling happy at the turn of events, I thanked the assistant and the assessor\nfor their work.\n\"YOU COME AND GO SO MANY TIMES FOR THIS WORK, but you never think of giving us\nsomething for our expenses. GIVE AT LEAST 1000 TO HIM\", the assessor finally\nlet his frustration out.\nI was feeling ashamed on hearing it.\nI asked the person to come outside the office. There I took two Rs. 500 notes\nand gave it to him. Emotions of shame, pity and thankfulness suppressed the\nanalytical side of my brain.\n• • •\nThinking through this episode now, I could have saved myself a lot of work and money\nby going directly to the assessor, dropping the letter along with a Rs. 500\nnote, like a professional.\nBut would that improve things? No.\nI should still give the application in the Zonal office, where I get an\nacknowledgement with the date of submission. It is likely that the SLA of 30\ndays is being tracked, which is why the assessor finished the work without me\npushing for it.\nI should also insist on online transfer or card payment instead of the DD. Even\nif it meant bribing the assessor.\nEven if my mom is true, and government officers do not commit fraud, at least\nfor such small amounts, the DD business gives undue power to the officers in\naddition to being cumbersome. All three must be put to an end.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/vacant-land-tax/","title":"Vacant Land Tax"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/visualizing-historical-rainfall-2/":{"body":"In 2023, I made a visualization of the historical rainfall over my farm to help me improve my farming practice.

This is even more important for growing crops only with rain water. So having good intutive understanding of the action of water on soil is important for successful farming.\nThe following video shows live demonstrations of how water flows on different soil types and layers.\n\nThis video helped me reason the effectivenss of a no-till agriculture. Following are the thoughts I had when I watched this video:\n\n\nAggregated soil, is best for water penetration. Soil that is physically aggregated by plowing gets compacted after a one or two rains or irrgations. It forms a hard crust, which I have seen farmers manually break with a hoe before they irrigate, so that the irrigation is effective. Soil that is aggregated with organic matter, is held together with excrements from the soil life that act like glue and structure is not easily destroyed by water.\n\n\nThe aggregated soil needs to be at the top where rain falls and is not effective if it is buried below a layer of fine powdered or compacted soil. Also the pores and channels made by animals need to be exposed at the top. Disturbing the soil by shallow plouging or even a hoe closes these pores and channels. What aggregated soil that may remain below the plough line is ineffective.\n\n\nOrganic matter that is buried below the soil does not help water infiltration. Traditionally it resulted in rapid decomposition and release of nutrients, but as with all techniques that help with short term results, you are basically stealing from your future. Organic matter is best left at the top as a mulch where it aids water infiltration, provides natural protection for insects, worms and animals which improve the soil structure. It also shades the soil and provides a better environment for the creatures to thrive. Fertility build up takes more time in this scenario, but is more resilient and increases over time, instead of getting depleted as with ploughing.\n\n\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/blog/water-on-soil/","title":"Water on soil"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/bookmarks/":{"body":"\nOpen Source apps\n\nFantasy Consoles and emulators\n\nTIC-80 - Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, Raspberry PI\n\n\nMaps\n\nOrganic Maps - Runs on Android\n\n\n\n\nElectrical / Electronics\n\nsci.electronics.repair FAQ - I fondly remember my days, pouring through this, in an attempt to repair my CRT monitor.\n\n\nProgramming\n\nAssembly Language\n\nUnderstanding Windows x64 Assembly\nLearn Assembly Language - x86 (32-bit) assembly language on Linux\n\n\nRust\n\nRustlings - Small exercises in Rust\n\n\nWhat Every Programmer Should Know About Memory\nTumble Forth\nOSDev wiki\n\n\nDIY\n\nSimplifier\nOriparts - Car parts catalog with part numbers\ni10 Forum\nConcrete lathe\nPassive cooling\n\n\nMathematics\n\nTom Körner's Home Page\nSeeing Theory - A visual introduction to probability and statistics\nConditional probability - A visual explanation\n\n\nK-12\n\nIndian Computing Olympiad\n\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nTools Direct\n\n\n\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/bookmarks/","title":"Bookmarks"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/":{"body":"This is my attempt at documenting the different crops, when and where they should be planted, their growth and their uses.\n\nGreen Gram\nHorse Gram\nSunn Hemp\n\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/","title":"Crop Notes"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/green-gram/":{"body":"Green gram, aka Pacchai Payaru or Paasi Payaru in Tamil, and Mung in Hindi, was the first crop I had planted, around January 2023. Till date this has also been the easist and one of the bountiful crops for me.\nPlanting Season\nThe best planting season has been the Margazhi pattam (December - January), at the end of the North East monsoon rains. It can handle a bit of water logging, even if the monsoon continues after the planting. This is unlike the horse gram which I had planted along with it, which decayed in the water due to a unexpected heavy rain in January.\nThe greengram that I had planted in March / April withered away, even though I had irrigated it once per week. It likely needs more water than this and is not suitable as a summer crop. It is also possible that a more fertile soil might have helped it handle the summer better. Something to experiment in the future.\nFertility Requirement\nWith added organice fertilizers, it surely would give a better yield, but, can give a reasonable yield even without it. The second year crop in 2024, planted in December yielded better due to more organic content and nitrogen in the soil, from the mucuna planted earlier.\nPlanting and Growth\nThe seeds can be planted directly without soaking in water, provided, the soil has sufficient moisture or if you will irrigate it immediately. The seeds germinate and seedlings, with two leaves, show up in less than a week.\nThe plant flowers in 1.5 months and the green pods should show up in 2 months. The pods dry and turn black, in a week or so, and it should be ready for the first picking. The first flush of pods ripen over 2 weeks and you have more flowers and pods coming up thereafter, which you can continue to pick. The best yield is from the first two pickings. The yield and the quality of the pods reduces thereafter and might not be economical.\nPost Harvest Processing\nThe pods can be dried on a tarp under the sun and stamped with the feet to shatter the pods. Another technique is to put the pods in a sack, and with its mouth closed, gently beat it with a stick to shatter the pods. You may have to crush the remaining pods with your fingers to extract the last bit that refuse to shatter by the above methods.\nAfter this, it can be winnowed to separate the seeds from the shattered shell. Muram, as it is called in Tamil, is a traditional tool that is used to separate light husks or shells from the heavier seeds. It needs a bit of practice to use it, but is sufficient for home scale use. I have not tried larger scale machines at this point.\nThe output of the separation is the whole green gram with the green outer skin. This whole green gram can be directly used for cooking. Further removal of the outer skin and splitting the seed results in the yellow split gram known as Payatham Paruppu in Tamil. This is conventionally used to make the famous Ven Pongal dish of Tamil Nadu.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/green-gram/","title":"Green Gram"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/horse-gram/":{"body":"Horse gram, aka Kollu in Tamil, has been the most difficult crop for me. It does not tolerate water logging and the seeds are difficult to separate from the pods. The growing period is 4 months which also increases the risk of unfavourable weather. In spite of this, it is worth growing, as it is a super food that we should add in our diet. Hopefully you get the strength of a horse after eating it.\nPlanting Season\nI have had limited success with sowing in mid December, but some of the crop wasted away due to water logging from an unexpected heavy rain in January. The remaining crop did grow well with irrigation, as the north-east monsoon ended. I had also tried a summer crop planted in March and April, but it did not have good growth, likely due to poor soil and lack of moisture because of poor irrigation.\nFertility Requirement\nThis grows well in degraded soils without any added fertilizers.\nPlanting and Growth\nThe dry seeds can be sowed in wet soil if you expect continued showers, or the dry soil can be irrigated after sowing. The seeds germinate in less than a week.\nThe plant flowers after 2.5 months and are easy to miss as they are pale green in colour. It takes another month for the pods to mature and dry. Since all plants and all pods do not mature at the same time, you may still need to wait for a couple of more weeks, before you can harvest. Unlike other pulses like Green Gram where the pods can be picked, the whole horsegram plant needs to be uprooted, due to the pods being small and numerous.\nPost Harvest Processing\nThe pods along with the vines are sun dried on a tarp and beaten with a stick to separate the seeds. The dislodged seeeds and the shells are winnowed to separate each other. There can be considerable loses in the unshattered pods, which are difficult to even separate by hand.\n","id":"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/horse-gram/","title":"Horse Gram"},"https://arunkd13.github.io/crops/sunn-hemp/":{"body":"Sunn Hemp, aka Sanappai in Tamil, is a leguminous green manure cover crop (GMCC), but cannot be used as food. It's stem's are a source of natural fibre, which are used for making ropes. I am using this crop mainly as a GMCC for the nitrogen it fixes and the biomass it generates. It also has a hard woody tap root, which I assume helps break compacted soil.\nPlanting Season\nSunn Hemp takes around 4 to 4.5 months for the seeds to be ready for harvest.\nI tried this crop initially in April 2023, when I planted it on a field, which I had shallow ploughed with a rotavator attached to a tractor. I did not have irrigation facility in this area and the land did not capture sufficient moisture from the summer rains for the crop to grow. All of them withered after growing about half a feet.\nI then planted it on a 1 meter wide bed in May, where I was able to irrigate it. This crop grew well and I was able to harvest the seeds around September.\nI again planted it in December 2024 and irrigated it through February March, which also has grown well and has formed green pods as of April 2024.\nSince Sunn Hemp is said to grow well with minimal water, I want to develop this as a summer cover crop that I plant in March and irrigate it minimally. Right now I am using Mucuna during this period, which requires copious amount of water for irrigation.\nFertility Requirement\nSunn Hemp grows well in degraded soil. The only requirement I have seen is that, it needs to be able to form sufficient root depth. For this the soil either should not be heavily compacted, or there should be sufficient irrigation until it is established.\nPlanting and Growth\nI have not seen many insects or ants eating the Sunn Hemp seeds. So this can be easily sown by broadcasting and raking at a shallow depth and germinates within a week. The growth is slow for the initial 2.5 months, but is rapid after that, and reaches a height of more than 6 feet. Even if the plants are eaten by rabbits and pigs in the initial growth phase, it forms new branches and grows vigorously in the second phase.\nThe plants grow tall and so, can easily be broken by heavy winds or animal movement. Establishing a dense cover can help prevent them from falling over.\nPost Harvest Processing\nI haven't tried extracting fibre from the stems. I have only harvested the seeds to use them for the next crop. The pods mature a bit staggered. So picking them individually might increase the yield. But since they are small, it becomes very labour intesive, and so I cut the entire branch and dry them. Once they are dry, the branches can be beaten with a stick and stamped with the feet to dislodge the pods and the seeds within the pods.\nSince I use this only as seed for the next crop, I just store the mixture of seeds and broken specks of the dry shell and do not bother with extensive winnowing to get clean seeds.\nIf the plant is allowed to bear seeds, the stems become woody and the biomass it generates is bit difficult to handle as a mulch. So it might be beneficial to cut this early as soon as it flowers and grow another stand separately for seeds.
